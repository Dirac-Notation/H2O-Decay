{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Prison Link Cymru had 1,099 referrals in 2015-16 and said some ex-offenders were living rough for up to a year before finding suitable accommodation. Workers at the charity claim investment in housing would be cheaper than jailing homeless repeat offenders. The Welsh Government said more people than ever were getting help to address housing problems. Changes to the Housing Act in Wales, introduced in 2015, removed the right for prison leavers to be given priority for accommodation. Prison Link Cymru, which helps people find accommodation after their release, said things were generally good for women because issues such as children or domestic violence were now considered. However, the same could not be said for men, the charity said, because issues which often affect them, such as post traumatic stress disorder or drug dependency, were often viewed as less of a priority. Andrew Stevens, who works in Welsh prisons trying to secure housing for prison leavers, said the need for accommodation was \"chronic\". \"There's a desperate need for it, finding suitable accommodation for those leaving prison there is just a lack of it everywhere,\" he said. \"It could take six months to a year, without a lot of help they could be on the streets for six months. \"When you think of the consequences of either being on the street, especially with the cold weather at the moment or you may have a roof over your head, sometimes there is only one choice.\" Mr Stevens believes building more one-bedroom flats could help ease the problem. \"The average price is a hundred pounds a week to keep someone in a rented flat, prison is a lot more than that so I would imagine it would save the public purse quite a few pounds,\" he said. Official figures show 830 one-bedroom properties were built in the year to March 2016, of an overall total of 6,900 new properties in Wales. Marc, 50, who has been in and out of prison for the past 20 years for burglary offences, said he struggled to find accommodation each time he was released. He said he would ask himself: \"Where am I going to stay? Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\" \"You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it. It's like every man for himself, there's nothing.\" Marc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing. \"You feel safe, you got hot food, you've got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It's a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said. Tom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available. \"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven't got accommodation and haven't got provision,\" he said. \"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don't delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can't. \"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\" A Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence. It added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "There is a \"chronic\" need for more housing for prison leavers in Wales, according to a charity.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA Welsh charity says it is having to turn people away from its services because there is not enough suitable accommodation for them.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "A", "\u0120Welsh", "\u0120charity", "\u0120says", "\u0120it", "\u0120is", "\u0120having", "\u0120to", "\u0120turn", "\u0120people", "\u0120away", "\u0120from", "\u0120its", "\u0120services", "\u0120because", "\u0120there", "\u0120is", "\u0120not", "\u0120enough", "\u0120suitable", "\u0120accommodation", "\u0120for", "\u0120them", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Article", ":", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Pr", "ison", "ers", "\u0120released", "\u0120from", "\u0120jail", "\u0120are", "\u0120being", "\u0120turned", "\u0120away", "\u0120from", "\u0120homeless", "\u0120services", ",", "\u0120a", "\u0120charity", "\u0120has", "\u0120said", ".", "\u0120Prison", "ers", "\u0120are", "\u0120being", "\u0120told", "\u0120they", "\u0120do", "\u0120not", "\u0120qualify", "\u0120for", "\u0120help"], "token_logprobs": [-2.86102294921875e-06, -0.90625, -0.00850677490234375, -0.0806884765625, -0.984375, -0.49169921875, -0.206787109375, -0.52978515625, -0.002086639404296875, -0.55419921875, -0.0001569986343383789, -1.3113021850585938e-06, -0.29736328125, -0.01364898681640625, -0.060546875, -0.0004298686981201172, -0.0802001953125, -0.09185791015625, -0.011260986328125, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -0.291748046875, -0.1602783203125, -0.1395263671875, -0.004276275634765625, -0.07958984375, -0.042999267578125, 0.0, -0.33203125, -1.6689300537109375e-06, -0.0003800392150878906, -0.00107574462890625, -0.0003948211669921875, -0.732421875, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -0.89501953125, 0.0, -0.0035610198974609375, -1.0283203125, -0.060455322265625, -0.125, -0.31884765625, -0.028594970703125, -0.203857421875, -5.7220458984375e-06, -0.00785064697265625, -0.03570556640625, -0.0421142578125, -0.049285888671875, -0.06951904296875, -0.004238128662109375, -0.00315093994140625, -0.1934814453125, -2.0265579223632812e-06, -0.19189453125, -0.004695892333984375, -0.215576171875, -0.1434326171875, -0.1845703125, -0.0682373046875, -0.2467041015625, 0.0, -0.03424072265625, -0.0004611015319824219, -0.1622314453125], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": -1.1920928955078125e-07, "A": -0.90625, "\u0120Welsh": -0.00850677490234375, "\u0120charity": -0.004238128662109375, "\u0120says": -0.984375, "\u0120it": -0.49169921875, "\u0120is": -0.09185791015625, "\u0120having": -0.52978515625, "\u0120to": -0.002086639404296875, "\u0120turn": -0.55419921875, "\u0120people": -0.0001569986343383789, "\u0120away": -5.7220458984375e-06, "\u0120from": -0.00785064697265625, "\u0120its": -0.01364898681640625, "\u0120services": -0.0421142578125, "\u0120because": -0.0004298686981201172, "\u0120there": -0.0802001953125, "\u0120not": 0.0, "\u0120enough": -1.1920928955078125e-07, "\u0120suitable": -0.291748046875, "\u0120accommodation": -0.1602783203125, "\u0120for": -0.0004611015319824219, "\u0120them": -0.004276275634765625, ".": -2.0265579223632812e-06, "###": -0.33203125, "Article": -0.00107574462890625, ":": -0.0003948211669921875, "Pr": -0.89501953125, "ison": 0.0, "ers": -0.004695892333984375, "\u0120released": -1.0283203125, "\u0120jail": -0.125, "\u0120are": -0.215576171875, "\u0120being": -0.1434326171875, "\u0120turned": -0.203857421875, "\u0120homeless": -0.03570556640625, ",": -0.049285888671875, "\u0120a": -0.06951904296875, "\u0120has": -0.00315093994140625, "\u0120said": -0.1934814453125, "\u0120Prison": -0.19189453125, "\u0120told": -0.1845703125, "\u0120they": -0.0682373046875, "\u0120do": -0.2467041015625, "\u0120qualify": -0.03424072265625, "\u0120help": -0.1622314453125}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Jordan Hill, Brittany Covington and Tesfaye Cooper, all 18, and Tanishia Covington, 24, appeared in a Chicago court on Friday. The four have been charged with hate crimes and aggravated kidnapping and battery, among other things. An online fundraiser for their victim has collected $51,000 (\u00c2\u00a342,500) so far. Denying the four suspects bail, Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil asked: \"Where was your sense of decency?\" Prosecutors told the court the beating started in a van and continued at a house, where the suspects allegedly forced the 18-year-old white victim, who suffers from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, to drink toilet water and kiss the floor. Police allege the van was earlier stolen by Mr Hill, who is also accused of demanding $300 from the victim's mother while they held him captive, according to the Chicago Tribune. The court was also told the suspects stuffed a sock into his mouth, taped his mouth shut and bound his hands with a belt. In a video made for Facebook Live which was watched millions of times, the assailants can be heard making derogatory statements against white people and Donald Trump.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Restoring the function of the organ - which helps control blood sugar levels - reversed symptoms of diabetes in animal experiments. The study, published in the journal Cell, says the diet reboots the body. Experts said the findings were \"potentially very exciting\" as they could become a new treatment for the disease. The experiments were on mice put on a modified form of the \"fasting-mimicking diet\". When people go on it they spend five days on a low calorie, low protein, low carbohydrate but high unsaturated-fat diet. It resembles a vegan diet with nuts and soups, but with around 800 to 1,100 calories a day. Then they have 25 days eating what they want - so overall it mimics periods of feast and famine. Previous research has suggested it can slow the pace of ageing. But animal experiments showed the diet regenerated a special type of cell in the pancreas called a beta cell. These are the cells that detect sugar in the blood and release the hormone insulin if it gets too high. Dr Valter Longo, from the University of Southern California, said: \"Our conclusion is that by pushing the mice into an extreme state and then bringing them back - by starving them and then feeding them again - the cells in the pancreas are triggered to use some kind of developmental reprogramming that rebuilds the part of the organ that's no longer functioning.\" There were benefits in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the mouse experiments. Type 1 is caused by the immune system destroying beta cells and type 2 is largely caused by lifestyle and the body no longer responding to insulin. Further tests on tissue samples from people with type 1 diabetes produced similar effects. Dr Longo said: \"Medically, these findings have the potential to be very important because we've shown - at least in mouse models - that you can use diet to reverse the symptoms of diabetes. \"Scientifically, the findings are perhaps even more important because we've shown that you can use diet to reprogram cells without having to make any genetic alterations.\" BBC reporter Peter Bowes took part in a separate trial with Dr Valter Longo. He said: \"During each five-day fasting cycle, when I ate about a quarter of the average person's diet, I lost between 2kg and 4kg (4.4-8.8lbs). \"But before the next cycle came round, 25 days of eating normally had returned me almost to my original weight. \"But not all consequences of the diet faded so quickly.\" His blood pressure was lower as was a hormone called IGF-1, which is linked to some cancers. He said: \"The very small meals I was given during the five-day fast were far from gourmet cooking, but I was glad to have something to eat\" Peter Bowes: Fasting for science Peter Bowes: Intermittent fasting and the good things it did to my body Separate trials of the diet in people have been shown to improve blood sugar levels. The latest findings help to explain why. However, Dr Longo said people should not rush off and crash diet. He told the BBC: \"It boils down to do not try this at home, this is so much more sophisticated than people realise.\" He said people could \"get into trouble\" with their health if it was done without medical guidance. Dr Emily Burns, research communications manager at Diabetes UK, said: \"This is potentially very exciting news, but we need to see if the results hold true in humans before we'll know more about what it means for people with diabetes. \"People with type-1 and type-2 diabetes would benefit immensely from treatments that can repair or regenerate insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\" Follow James on Twitter.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The pancreas can be triggered to regenerate itself through a type of fasting diet, say US researchers.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA diet that mimics the effects of fasting in mice has been found to reverse diabetes in the animals.\n\nWhat is the best way to cite this article?\n\n(Source: Cell)\n\nWhat is the best way to cite this article?\n\n(Cell)\n\nHow do I cit", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "A", "\u0120diet", "\u0120that", "\u0120mim", "ics", "\u0120the", "\u0120effects", "\u0120of", "\u0120fasting", "\u0120in", "\u0120mice", "\u0120has", "\u0120been", "\u0120found", "\u0120to", "\u0120reverse", "\u0120diabetes", "\u0120in", "\u0120the", "\u0120animals", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "What", "\u0120is", "\u0120the", "\u0120best", "\u0120way", "\u0120to", "\u0120cite", "\u0120this", "\u0120article", "?", "\u010a", "\u010a", "(", "Source", ":", "\u0120Cell", ")", "\u010a", "\u010a", "What", "\u0120is", "\u0120the", "\u0120best", "\u0120way", "\u0120to", "\u0120cite", "\u0120this", "\u0120article", "?", "\u010a", "\u010a", "(", "Cell", ")", "\u010a", "\u010a", "How", "\u0120do", "\u0120I", "\u0120cite"], "token_logprobs": [-3.6954879760742188e-06, -0.82421875, -0.47705078125, -0.00997161865234375, -0.30517578125, -0.0001914501190185547, -0.319580078125, -0.282958984375, 0.0, -0.003215789794921875, -1.1318359375, -0.0002803802490234375, -0.21142578125, -0.013336181640625, -0.5107421875, -1.0728836059570312e-06, -0.148681640625, -0.1563720703125, -0.06768798828125, -0.265625, -0.0347900390625, -0.008270263671875, -0.11309814453125, 0.0, -0.4248046875, -0.06298828125, -0.0004189014434814453, -0.41845703125, -0.0007953643798828125, -7.3909759521484375e-06, -0.24169921875, -0.00023806095123291016, -0.0007534027099609375, -0.0182037353515625, -2.3126602172851562e-05, -0.002254486083984375, -0.002185821533203125, -0.55078125, -0.017059326171875, -0.0009546279907226562, -0.059967041015625, -0.0099334716796875, 0.0, -0.479736328125, -0.0022068023681640625, -5.924701690673828e-05, -0.0064697265625, -0.004730224609375, -8.344650268554688e-07, -1.9669532775878906e-05, -0.0247955322265625, -0.004375457763671875, -8.106231689453125e-06, -0.0003345012664794922, -0.0002868175506591797, -0.0002332925796508789, -0.006977081298828125, -0.03973388671875, -0.022308349609375, 0.0, -0.424560546875, -0.294921875, -0.039398193359375, -0.00698089599609375], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": 0.0, "A": -0.82421875, "\u0120diet": -0.47705078125, "\u0120that": -0.00997161865234375, "\u0120mim": -0.30517578125, "ics": -0.0001914501190185547, "\u0120the": -5.924701690673828e-05, "\u0120effects": -0.282958984375, "\u0120of": 0.0, "\u0120fasting": -0.003215789794921875, "\u0120in": -0.06768798828125, "\u0120mice": -0.0002803802490234375, "\u0120has": -0.21142578125, "\u0120been": -0.013336181640625, "\u0120found": -0.5107421875, "\u0120to": -8.344650268554688e-07, "\u0120reverse": -0.148681640625, "\u0120diabetes": -0.1563720703125, "\u0120animals": -0.0347900390625, ".": -0.008270263671875, "What": -0.479736328125, "\u0120is": -0.0022068023681640625, "\u0120best": -0.0064697265625, "\u0120way": -0.004730224609375, "\u0120cite": -0.00698089599609375, "\u0120this": -0.0247955322265625, "\u0120article": -0.004375457763671875, "?": -8.106231689453125e-06, "(": -0.0002332925796508789, "Source": -0.55078125, ":": -0.017059326171875, "\u0120Cell": -0.0009546279907226562, ")": -0.03973388671875, "Cell": -0.006977081298828125, "How": -0.424560546875, "\u0120do": -0.294921875, "\u0120I": -0.039398193359375}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}
{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: But there certainly should be. These are two of the biggest firms in the lucrative international business of making spectacles. France's Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy's Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer. It is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is. \"The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,\" says Essilor. But there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry. Gordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: \"This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user. \"Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them. \"Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,\" Mr Ilett adds. If the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry. It will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica. One long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors. \"If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,\" he argues. In his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up. \"I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,\" he adds. Unless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by. But if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor. Just a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was \"an undisputed leader with only 25% market share\" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses. When it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market. For its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace. In 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses. The overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories. Market research firm GFK describes the optical industry as \"a complex and extremely competitive market-space\". Even so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (\u00c2\u00a312.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review. These are: An inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers. A Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal. \"The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,\" he said. \"We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,\" he added. The EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules. But the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution. \"Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,\" the firm says. \"It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself.\" If you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds. Of course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers. Opticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit. They also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising. But for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business. On worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros. For the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros. With cost-cutting at a merged business projected to save between 400m and 600m euros per year, profits could be boosted even further.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Media playback is not supported on this device The Olympic silver medallist accused the organisation of \"ageism\" and having \"zero regard\" for her welfare. She is the latest high-profile cyclist to come forward after Jess Varnish, Nicole Cooke and Emma Pooley criticised the World Class programme. Houvenaghel told the BBC she felt \"vindicated\" by a leaked draft report detailing British Cycling's failures. The report said British Cycling \"sanitised\" its own investigation into claims former technical director Shane Sutton used sexist language towards Varnish, who went public last April about her treatment. British Cycling subsequently admitted it did not pay \"sufficient care and attention\" to the wellbeing of staff and athletes at the expense of winning medals, an approach Houvenaghel attested to in her BBC interview. Both Sutton and predecessor Sir Dave Brailsford have now left British Cycling. Houvenaghel, 42, spoke to BBC Sport during its State of Sport week, which on Thursday examines the issue of athlete welfare versus a win-at-all-costs culture. A government-commissioned review, headed by 11-time Paralympic champion Baroness Grey-Thompson, into safety and wellbeing in British sport, is due to be published imminently. It is expected to recommend significant reforms designed to improve the way athletes are treated by governing bodies. Houvenaghel claimed: British Cycling said it \"has acknowledged and takes very seriously previous cultural and governance failings in the World Class Programme\". It said it has accepted the draft report's findings and already put into a place a 39-point action plan to \"systematically address the cultural and behavioural shortcomings\". The statement added: \"Our new chair Jonathan Browning has apologised for instances where we have fallen short in our commitment to athlete welfare and has offered to meet with anyone who can help improve British Cycling.\" Who else has spoken out? Houvenaghel won silver in the individual pursuit at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and gold in the World Championship team pursuit in 2008, 2009 and 2011. She retired in 2014, aged 39, after withdrawing from the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow with a back injury. Houvenaghel was critical of both Sutton and her team-mates in the aftermath of the London 2012 Olympics, where she was left out of all three team pursuit races as Dani King, Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell-Shand won gold in a world record time. Speaking to BBC Sport this week, the Northern Irish rider said that experience was \"very traumatic\" and she felt \"torment\" at having \"no explanation\" for her last-minute omission. At the time, Brailsford, then performance director, defended the selection saying they had to \"take the personal element out of it, and look at the data and be professional\". He added: \"I think when a team steps up and makes six world records on the trot and a gold medal, then I don't think you can argue with that.\" British Cycling reiterated that point on Thursday, adding it was \"proud to support Wendy in what was a wonderfully successful cycling career\" and she was \"part of a pioneering generation of riders who set new standards of excellence\", but was dropped in London 2012 \"based on her performance\". Other elite cyclists, including King and Roswell-Shand have praised the leadership at British Cycling. Asked whether she was simply not good enough for the 2012 team, Houvenaghel replied: \"It was definitely not about performance. I don't think the fastest team on the day were permitted to race. \"There are certain chosen riders on the team who will not have experienced the culture of fear and will not have been on the receiving end of that - the bullying, the harassment, being frozen out of opportunities. \"It was horrid - it was not the training environment I expected. There was no choice. If you rocked the boat, you were out. There was no alternative. \"Medals at any cost, that's how it was whenever I was there, certainly in 2012.\" Houvenaghel said she also witnessed the sexism that has been highlighted by other female riders, and also claims she was discriminated against because of her age. \"I can certainly relate to the bullying,\" she said. \"For me personally, I felt it was more ageism - being a little bit older than my team-mates, it didn't seem to be something that the staff necessarily wanted for our team in 2012. \"They didn't care about what happened to me afterwards. I never heard another thing from them. \"After six years of constantly medalling at World Cups, World Championships, nationals, both on the track and on the road, they discarded me in a very undignified way from the team, which I don't feel was right.\" Fourteen-time Paralympic gold medallist Dame Sarah Storey told BBC Sport that elite level sport in Britain is \"cut-throat\" but there are \"no excuses for crossing that line\" into bullying. Asked about the balance between winning and athlete welfare, the 39-year-old replied: \"It's a really difficult question because you have to be a human being, you have to allow for people to make mistakes. But the currency is race wins, the currency is gold medals. \"It's not an excuse but you have to have a thick skin in sport, you have to be able to take the rough with the smooth because of the racing that you go through. \"But there are no excuses for crossing that line, and if those lines have been crossed they will be found out and they'll be dealt with.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A \"medal at any cost\" approach created a \"culture of fear\" at British Cycling, says former rider Wendy Houvenaghel.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nBritish Cycling has been accused of bullying and sexism in a damning report.\n\nWhat is the most important thing you learned from this article?\n\nThe importance of athlete welfare and the need for transparency in elite sport.</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "British", "\u0120Cycling", "\u0120has", "\u0120been", "\u0120accused", "\u0120of", "\u0120bullying", "\u0120and", "\u0120sexism", "\u0120in", "\u0120a", "\u0120damning", "\u0120report", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "What", "\u0120is", "\u0120the", "\u0120most", "\u0120important", "\u0120thing", "\u0120you", "\u0120learned", "\u0120from", "\u0120this", "\u0120article", "?", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "\u0120importance", "\u0120of", "\u0120athlete", "\u0120welfare", "\u0120and", "\u0120the", "\u0120need", "\u0120for", "\u0120transparency", "\u0120in", "\u0120elite", "\u0120sport", ".", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [-0.0001957416534423828, -0.0271148681640625, -2.2172927856445312e-05, -0.2509765625, -0.05877685546875, -0.0753173828125, -0.00018537044525146484, -0.81982421875, -0.0472412109375, -0.0050811767578125, -0.2037353515625, -0.018646240234375, -0.607421875, -0.0032329559326171875, -0.2275390625, -0.056640625, 0.0, -0.0435791015625, -0.59619140625, -0.050201416015625, -0.349365234375, -0.01076507568359375, -0.07952880859375, -0.012054443359375, -0.28271484375, -0.00390625, -0.1876220703125, -8.928775787353516e-05, -3.5762786865234375e-07, -5.2094459533691406e-05, 0.0, -0.68701171875, -0.056915283203125, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -0.02215576171875, -0.0005354881286621094, -0.59765625, -0.021331787109375, -0.010650634765625, -0.126953125, -0.1700439453125, -0.1605224609375, -0.1961669921875, -0.0010671615600585938, -2.5510787963867188e-05, -0.050079345703125], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": 0.0, "British": -0.0271148681640625, "\u0120Cycling": -2.2172927856445312e-05, "\u0120has": -0.2509765625, "\u0120been": -0.05877685546875, "\u0120accused": -0.0753173828125, "\u0120of": -1.1920928955078125e-07, "\u0120bullying": -0.81982421875, "\u0120and": -0.59765625, "\u0120sexism": -0.0050811767578125, "\u0120in": -0.1605224609375, "\u0120a": -0.018646240234375, "\u0120damning": -0.607421875, "\u0120report": -0.0032329559326171875, ".": -2.5510787963867188e-05, "What": -0.0435791015625, "\u0120is": -0.59619140625, "\u0120the": -0.021331787109375, "\u0120most": -0.349365234375, "\u0120important": -0.01076507568359375, "\u0120thing": -0.07952880859375, "\u0120you": -0.012054443359375, "\u0120learned": -0.28271484375, "\u0120from": -0.00390625, "\u0120this": -0.1876220703125, "\u0120article": -8.928775787353516e-05, "?": -3.5762786865234375e-07, "The": -0.68701171875, "\u0120importance": -0.056915283203125, "\u0120athlete": -0.02215576171875, "\u0120welfare": -0.0005354881286621094, "\u0120need": -0.010650634765625, "\u0120for": -0.126953125, "\u0120transparency": -0.1700439453125, "\u0120elite": -0.1961669921875, "\u0120sport": -0.0010671615600585938, "</s>": -0.050079345703125}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}
{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: It's no joke. But Kareem Badr says people did laugh in 2009 when he and two friends paid $20,000 (\u00c2\u00a313,000) for the Hideout in Austin, when it wasn't making money and the previous owner decided not to renew the lease. \"We took over a sinking ship and each brought a bucket to bail it out,\" says Mr Badr. \"None of us had any experience of running a business. But we loved what we were doing enough that it carried us through.\" Three years ago he was able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club. Mr Badr says it's still not as much as he used to make as a programmer (about $80,000 a year), but he now employs around 25 part time and contract workers. And he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space. Mr Badr says: \"I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient. \"That's basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve.\" Mr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US. An industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020. \"When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin,\" says Mr Badr. \"But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time.\" While the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age. \"The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent,\" he says. \"In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars.\" Mr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news. \"It's not just entertaining them, it's also informing them,\" he says. \"There's a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that's on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging.\" But clubs don't only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night's takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person. \"A club really has three businesses going on,\" says Mr Rosenfield. \"It's an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge. \"There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics. The middle act does about half an hour, and then there's the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year.\" Top-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year. Steve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons. He describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring. And although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income. Mr Bryne says: \"Gigs vary because it depends what you're contracted at. \"If it's somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who's had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500. \"And if you're just a knock out comic, then you're coming in and getting a door deal. You're taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions.\" Mr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks. \"The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh? \"Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience.\" While the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost. \"The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits,\" he says. \"It's become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they'll book him almost sight unseen. That's it. \"Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while.\" But in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh. Back in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September. He says: \"We all thought 'who's going to come to a comedy club? The dream's over, I've got to get a real job now'. \"But after a week, I forget which club was the first one to open its doors, but it was packed. People needed an outlet. \"And I remember for months on end those clubs in New York City were just jam packed. That was the thing that told me that this was a profession that is foolproof.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Have you heard the one about the computer programmer who bought a failing comedy club in Texas and turned it into a million dollar a year business?", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe article is about a comedy club in Austin, Texas that has been in business for over 20 years.\n\nSummarize the article in 1-2 sentences.\n\nThe article is about a comedy club in Austin, Texas that has been in business for over 20 years.\n\nSummarize th", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "The", "\u0120article", "\u0120is", "\u0120about", "\u0120a", "\u0120comedy", "\u0120club", "\u0120in", "\u0120Austin", ",", "\u0120Texas", "\u0120that", "\u0120has", "\u0120been", "\u0120in", "\u0120business", "\u0120for", "\u0120over", "\u012020", "\u0120years", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Sum", "mar", "ize", "\u0120the", "\u0120article", "\u0120in", "\u01201", "-", "2", "\u0120sentences", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "\u0120article", "\u0120is", "\u0120about", "\u0120a", "\u0120comedy", "\u0120club", "\u0120in", "\u0120Austin", ",", "\u0120Texas", "\u0120that", "\u0120has", "\u0120been", "\u0120in", "\u0120business", "\u0120for", "\u0120over", "\u012020", "\u0120years", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Sum", "mar", "ize", "\u0120the"], "token_logprobs": [-2.86102294921875e-06, -0.6611328125, -0.62158203125, -0.321533203125, -0.071044921875, -0.11236572265625, -0.998046875, 0.0, -0.58837890625, -0.000797271728515625, -0.0011844635009765625, -0.0067138671875, -0.6865234375, -0.66796875, -0.06402587890625, -0.4931640625, -0.0015153884887695312, -0.01461029052734375, -0.27294921875, -0.1236572265625, 0.0, -0.00843048095703125, -0.08245849609375, 0.0, -0.689453125, -0.0007872581481933594, -4.76837158203125e-07, -4.00543212890625e-05, -0.005481719970703125, -0.00029087066650390625, -0.0411376953125, -0.3818359375, -0.003082275390625, -0.006198883056640625, -0.00012421607971191406, -7.152557373046875e-07, 0.0, -0.0258331298828125, -0.6630859375, -0.0002830028533935547, -1.4662742614746094e-05, -0.002613067626953125, -1.895427703857422e-05, 0.0, -0.004634857177734375, -2.384185791015625e-07, -7.390975952148438e-05, -3.4570693969726562e-06, -9.09566879272461e-05, -6.079673767089844e-06, 0.0, -0.0008378028869628906, -5.960464477539062e-07, -0.0001741647720336914, -0.0005617141723632812, -8.690357208251953e-05, 0.0, -0.0015764236450195312, -0.012359619140625, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -0.00014472007751464844, 0.0, 0.0, -4.0531158447265625e-06], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": -1.1920928955078125e-07, "The": -0.0258331298828125, "\u0120article": -0.6630859375, "\u0120is": -0.0002830028533935547, "\u0120about": -1.4662742614746094e-05, "\u0120a": -0.002613067626953125, "\u0120comedy": -1.895427703857422e-05, "\u0120club": 0.0, "\u0120in": -0.0008378028869628906, "\u0120Austin": -2.384185791015625e-07, ",": -7.390975952148438e-05, "\u0120Texas": -3.4570693969726562e-06, "\u0120that": -9.09566879272461e-05, "\u0120has": -6.079673767089844e-06, "\u0120been": 0.0, "\u0120business": -5.960464477539062e-07, "\u0120for": -0.0001741647720336914, "\u0120over": -0.0005617141723632812, "\u012020": -8.690357208251953e-05, "\u0120years": 0.0, ".": -0.0015764236450195312, "Sum": -0.00014472007751464844, "mar": 0.0, "ize": 0.0, "\u0120the": -4.0531158447265625e-06, "\u01201": -0.0411376953125, "-": -0.3818359375, "2": -0.003082275390625, "\u0120sentences": -0.006198883056640625}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}
{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Relieved that the giant telecoms company would not be broken up, they piled into the shares, sending them up 3% in early trading. BT dodged a bullet - and, as the chief executive of Ofcom, Sharon White, admitted, it was for prosaic reasons. She said complications with land deals and BT's giant pension scheme meant there were \"practical obstacles\" to a break-up that would delay the process several years. It's the pension scheme that probably most influenced Ofcom's thinking. BT's retirement scheme, inherited from its time as a state-owned utility, has assets of about \u00c2\u00a340bn and a deficit, on some measures, of about \u00c2\u00a310bn, even though BT has poured in billions of pounds in recent years to redress the gap. Senior sources at the company say that about 80% of the scheme relates to Openreach, the internet infrastructure provider that BT's rivals would like to see spun off. Separating the pension as part of a break-up would be a costly headache - and there is the small matter of a government guarantee on part of the scheme, something that BT fought in the courts to preserve and won. Creating two new pension schemes, with the risk of weakening the financial resources of one or the other, might be too hot a political potato, even in the pursuit of faster broadband. BT's share price reaction might turn out to be overdone. Ms White plans to enforce the separation by introducing not only a new board to run Openreach, but also new articles of association that will give directors a duty to serve customers of the network as much as the company's owners. This holds out an obvious prospect of conflicts to come, and runs counter to the normal assumption that in private companies, the shareholder is king. It also carries an echo of the \"golden shares\" held by the government in Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, two companies judged important for the defence of the realm.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: The move is in response to an \u00a38m cut in the subsidy received from the Department of Employment and Learning (DEL). The cut in undergraduate places will come into effect from September 2015. Job losses will be among both academic and non-academic staff and Queen's says no compulsory redundancies should be required. There are currently around 17,000 full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students at the university, and around 3,800 staff. Queen's has a current intake of around 4,500 undergraduates per year. The university aims to reduce the number of student places by 1,010 over the next three years. The BBC understands that there are no immediate plans to close departments or courses, but that the cuts in funding may put some departments and courses at risk. The Education Minister Stephen Farry said he recognised that some students might now choose to study in other areas of the UK because of the cuts facing Northern Ireland's universities. \"Some people will now be forced to look to opportunities in other parts of Great Britain and may not return to our economy,\" he said. \"Defunding our investment in skills, particularly at a time when we're trying to grow the economy does not make a lot of sense. What's happening is we're going backwards. \"The loss of any place is damaging to our economy, all subjects teach our young people critical skills.\" Queen's vice-chancellor Patrick Johnston said the cuts had the potential to damage the reputation of the university. \"The potential negative impact, not just on the university but on the local economy is very significant,\" he said. \"It's the last thing we want to do, but we have to begin to focus on those areas where we can grow the organisation and develop it - it's clear we can no longer depend on the public purse to fund tuition. \"If we're not competitive we will not attract the best students, and we will not attract the best staff.\" Just under \u00a3100m, a third of the university's income, comes from the Northern Ireland Executive.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Emily Thornberry said Labour would not \"frustrate Brexit\" even if it failed to amend the bill. Ten shadow ministers were among 47 Labour MPs who rejected party orders to back it last week. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said frontbenchers would have to quit if they defied the whip at the next vote. The draft legislation comes back to the Commons on Monday for three days of debate culminating in a vote on its third reading. Speaking on BBC's The Andrew Marr Show, Ms Thornberry rejected a suggestion the party was \"hopelessly divided\" on the issue. She said she understood colleagues not wanting to vote in favour of invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which begins the formal departure process, but said: \"We have said that we will not frustrate Brexit. We have got our instructions from the British people. We are democrats and the public have voted to leave the European Union.\" Labour will try to amend the draft legislation to secure what it calls a \"meaningful vote\" on the final deal struck between Theresa May and the EU, and to guarantee the status of EU nationals in the UK and Britons living elsewhere in Europe. Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis has said he will vote against the bill unless Labour's amendments are accepted, describing them as \"red lines\". Ms Thornberry declined to say whether they were non-negotiable red lines for her party, and denied it was \"illogical\" to demand amendments but still back the bill in the final vote if they are rejected. \"There will need to be back channels, private conversations. There are many conversations going on now,\" she said. \"We are speaking to government, we are speaking to Tory backbenchers and we are trying to get a compromise that will work.\" One of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's closest allies, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, missed Wednesday's vote, citing illness. Former Labour minister Caroline Flint criticised Ms Abbott, telling ITV's Peston on Sunday: \"We used to have man flu, we now have Brexit flu that Diane has created here\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it's about being part of a team. \"I think she holds one of the most important portfolios within a shadow cabinet. If she can't support the leader on this then she should go.\" But former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman defended Ms Abbott, pointing out she had earlier said on television she would back the bill so had \"already taken the flak on it\". Among the rebels in last week's second reading vote were 10 members of the front bench, who would ordinarily be expected to step down after defying leadership instructions to back the bill. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that changes to his shadow cabinet would be announced \"in the coming few days\". Asked if he should be lenient, he added: \"I'm a very lenient person.\" Speaking later, he said he expected Ms Abbott to vote with the party this week. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the shadow cabinet would decide how to approach Wednesday's third reading vote on the Brexit bill. He told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 live that if a three-line whip was again imposed, any frontbenchers who rebelled \"will have to step down\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The shadow foreign secretary has suggested Labour will continue to support legislation paving the way for Brexit as it passes through Parliament.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nTheresa May is a liar and a hypocrite.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n\nTheresa May is a liar and a hypocrite.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n\nTheresa May is a liar and a hypocrite.\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "The", "resa", "\u0120May", "\u0120is", "\u0120a", "\u0120liar", "\u0120and", "\u0120a", "\u0120hypocr", "ite", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Sum", "mar", "ize", "\u0120the", "\u0120above", "\u0120article", "\u0120in", "\u01201", "\u0120sentence", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "resa", "\u0120May", "\u0120is", "\u0120a", "\u0120liar", "\u0120and", "\u0120a", "\u0120hypocr", "ite", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Sum", "mar", "ize", "\u0120the", "\u0120above", "\u0120article", "\u0120in", "\u01201", "\u0120sentence", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "resa", "\u0120May", "\u0120is", "\u0120a", "\u0120liar", "\u0120and", "\u0120a", "\u0120hypocr", "ite", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a"], "token_logprobs": [-9.655952453613281e-06, -0.407470703125, -0.0017366409301757812, 0.0, -0.79638671875, -1.2646484375, -0.1807861328125, -0.45654296875, -0.005462646484375, -0.2177734375, 0.0, -0.0033054351806640625, -0.0025386810302734375, 0.0, -0.5947265625, -0.0017461776733398438, -3.5762786865234375e-07, -2.6226043701171875e-06, -0.00252532958984375, -0.00897979736328125, -0.0003457069396972656, -0.0117034912109375, -0.155029296875, -5.054473876953125e-05, -2.384185791015625e-07, -3.4570693969726562e-06, -0.0020389556884765625, -5.125999450683594e-06, 0.0, -0.0006995201110839844, -8.106231689453125e-06, -0.027130126953125, -0.0032329559326171875, -0.26611328125, 0.0, 0.0, -3.063678741455078e-05, -0.00038504600524902344, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -5.1140785217285156e-05, -6.651878356933594e-05, 0.0, -1.3589859008789062e-05, -0.037109375, -0.0001327991485595703, -0.0008311271667480469, -0.005130767822265625, -0.00449371337890625, -2.2649765014648438e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0002562999725341797, -2.384185791015625e-07, 0.0, -2.1457672119140625e-06, -3.5762786865234375e-07, -0.01251983642578125, -0.0013647079467773438, -0.07891845703125, 0.0, 0.0, -2.7418136596679688e-06, -0.00041747093200683594, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": 0.0, "The": -0.0002562999725341797, "resa": -2.384185791015625e-07, "\u0120May": 0.0, "\u0120is": -2.1457672119140625e-06, "\u0120a": -0.07891845703125, "\u0120liar": -0.01251983642578125, "\u0120and": -0.0013647079467773438, "\u0120hypocr": 0.0, "ite": 0.0, ".": -2.7418136596679688e-06, "Sum": -5.1140785217285156e-05, "mar": -6.651878356933594e-05, "ize": 0.0, "\u0120the": -1.3589859008789062e-05, "\u0120above": -0.037109375, "\u0120article": -0.0001327991485595703, "\u0120in": -0.0008311271667480469, "\u01201": -0.005130767822265625, "\u0120sentence": -0.00449371337890625}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The day before his death, he had asked staff for extra medication because he said he was feeling agitated, but they did not change his dosage because they could see no sign of agitation.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Dr Waleed Abdalati told the BBC the that continued access to data is in \"everyone's best interest\". Many US scientists are rushing to copy information onto servers outside the control of the federal government. They are afraid the Trump administration will curb access to climate and other research. The President-elect has blown hot and cold on the issue of climate change, having previously tweeted about global warming being a hoax. On Wednesday, one of his advisers compared scientists who support the mainstream view on global warming to flat-Earthers. \"There was an overwhelming science that the Earth was flat and there was an overwhelming science that we were the centre of the world,\" said Anthony Scaramucci, a member of the Trump transition committee, on CNN. \"We get a lot of things wrong in the scientific community.\" Now at the Co-operative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, Dr Abdalati served as Nasa's chief scientist in 2011, for two years. He says it is too early to tell if this type of rhetoric from the Trump team will be backed up by action against scientists working on climate issues. \"I do think that when it comes to access to federal databases, and information that the taxpayers have paid for, there would have to be a tremendous paradigm shift to actively take steps to make those data unavailable, and I think doing so would be an enormous disservice to the citizens of this country and to the world in general,\" he said via email. \"I do think that the scientific community, educators, members of the private sector who rely on these data in their businesses, and others will need to make clear that continued access to these data, which have been paid for by the taxpayers, allows their full value to be realized and is in everyone's best interest.\" Other researchers are taking a more pessimistic view on the question of data access and are encouraging colleagues and students to make copies. Prof Robert Paterson, from the University of Texas, Austin, says that he learned this the hard way under the administration of George W Bush, another president cool on climate. \"Within a month of coming into office the EPA website went down for three weeks and when it went back up stuff wasn't available anymore,\" Prof Paterson told BBC News. \"If history repeats itself with another administration that is basically a naysayer to climate change science, I would say it would be prudent for folks to do what they can to keep as much as they can on mirror sites.\" Other scientists are concerned about nominations to key government areas such as former Texas governor Rick Perry at Department of Energy (DoE) and Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt at the EPA. Both have heavily criticised the agencies they now lead. Attempts by the Trump transition team at the DoE to obtain a list of all those employees who had worked on climate change have provoked anger as well as fear. \"I was horrified by the report with regard to Department of Energy scientists being named.  We must stand up to that and I have said so. We are all DoE scientists in that regard,\" said Dr Kevin Trenberth who has been a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a senior scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). \"That is a pretty chilling action by an incoming administration - the rhetoric suggests that revenge is a valid response to people who disagree with you,\" said Prof Robert Paterson, The Energy department has refused to comply with the request and the Trump team has now said the questionnaire was \"not authorised\". Many researchers are worried that the anti-climate tone being struck by the incoming administration will have many serious consequences for scientists trying to do their jobs in real world situations. \"Flooding is a fact of life in Texas and the frequency with which we're seeing it is noticeably increasing,\" said Dr Shannon Van Zandt, at Texas A&M University. \"A lot of the tools that have been developed by Federal agencies have been designed to help communities predict the changes that they're going to see and if that is restricted we would lose the ability to help people understand and incorporate it into the decisions that they're making both at the local level and at the state policy level.\" But some in this field believe that the change of administration is a good moment to review the type of scientific questions that US researchers are asking. Marcel Crok is a Dutch science writer who doesn't support the scientific consensus on climate change. He says that much of the research in the field takes place in an echo chamber and he welcomes the fact that the Trump administration will challenge this. Mr Crok accepts that human emissions of carbon dioxide are warming the planet, but he questions the accepted view on how far and how rapidly temperatures will rise. Mainstream scientists, he says, rely on models that are over sensitive to carbon. He expects this to change under Trump. He said: \"What the field is trying to do is prove that the observational estimates are wrong and that the models are still right, and in my opinion this is exactly the problem. They should be more open minded, they should be open to the idea that the models are wrong!\" \"I hope that under a Trump regime at least there would be more funding, because if the funding agencies ask these kind of questions they can stimulate research in other directions than proving that the models are right all the time.\" The idea that aspects of climate research, supported by a minority, should now gain funding at the expense of the majority view, is dismissed by those in the field. \"It is not all spun, it is not all one side or the other,\" said Prof James White from the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado. \"This is good unbiased information, it would be a real shame if that data is turned off.\" Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Limiting access to federal research would do an \"enormous disservice\" to the US and the world according to former Nasa chief scientist.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Trump administration is making it harder for scientists to access federal data.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 tweet.\n\nThe Trump administration is making it harder for scientists to access federal data. https://t.co/1Hm5x6X2t</s", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "The", "\u0120Trump", "\u0120administration", "\u0120is", "\u0120making", "\u0120it", "\u0120harder", "\u0120for", "\u0120scientists", "\u0120to", "\u0120access", "\u0120federal", "\u0120data", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Sum", "mar", "ize", "\u0120the", "\u0120above", "\u0120article", "\u0120in", "\u01201", "\u0120tweet", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "\u0120Trump", "\u0120administration", "\u0120is", "\u0120making", "\u0120it", "\u0120harder", "\u0120for", "\u0120scientists", "\u0120to", "\u0120access", "\u0120federal", "\u0120data", ".", "\u0120https", "://", "t", ".", "co", "/", "1", "H", "m", "5", "x", "6", "X", "2", "t", "</s>"], "token_logprobs": [0.0, -0.1729736328125, -0.0211029052734375, -0.0019550323486328125, -0.1903076171875, -1.4794921875, -0.193115234375, -0.1441650390625, -0.0357666015625, -0.1199951171875, -4.1604042053222656e-05, -0.0721435546875, -0.350830078125, -0.005603790283203125, -0.377685546875, -0.035797119140625, 0.0, -0.19482421875, 0.0, -2.384185791015625e-07, -0.00022864341735839844, -0.020660400390625, -0.00020194053649902344, -0.00042819976806640625, -0.00276947021484375, -0.59375, -0.00098419189453125, -3.790855407714844e-05, 0.0, -0.3583984375, -1.430511474609375e-06, -2.300739288330078e-05, -4.0531158447265625e-06, -1.5497207641601562e-06, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -3.5762786865234375e-07, -9.5367431640625e-07, -9.775161743164062e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -1.9073486328125e-06, -1.430511474609375e-06, -0.00010979175567626953, -0.3779296875, 0.0, -1.9550323486328125e-05, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -3.017578125, -2.80859375, -2.716796875, -2.7109375, -2.8046875, -2.904296875, -2.8125, -2.84375, -2.603515625, -0.90185546875], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": 0.0, "The": -0.3583984375, "\u0120Trump": -1.430511474609375e-06, "\u0120administration": -2.300739288330078e-05, "\u0120is": -4.0531158447265625e-06, "\u0120making": -1.5497207641601562e-06, "\u0120it": -1.1920928955078125e-07, "\u0120harder": -3.5762786865234375e-07, "\u0120for": -9.5367431640625e-07, "\u0120scientists": -9.775161743164062e-06, "\u0120to": 0.0, "\u0120access": 0.0, "\u0120federal": -1.9073486328125e-06, "\u0120data": -1.430511474609375e-06, ".": 0.0, "Sum": -0.19482421875, "mar": 0.0, "ize": -2.384185791015625e-07, "\u0120the": -0.00022864341735839844, "\u0120above": -0.020660400390625, "\u0120article": -0.00020194053649902344, "\u0120in": -0.00042819976806640625, "\u01201": -0.00276947021484375, "\u0120tweet": -0.59375, "\u0120https": -0.3779296875, "://": 0.0, "t": -2.603515625, "co": 0.0, "/": 0.0, "1": -3.017578125, "H": -2.80859375, "m": -2.716796875, "5": -2.7109375, "x": -2.8046875, "6": -2.904296875, "X": -2.8125, "2": -2.84375, "</s>": -0.90185546875}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Pakistan's telecoms regulator said the ban was no longer necessary because Google, which owns YouTube, had now launched a Pakistan-specific version. YouTube has denied claims that the authorities can filter content. Many young Pakistanis have welcomed the lifting of the ban but some activists want details of the deal with Google. They say there should be greater transparency of the terms agreed between Google and the government. A Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) official confirmed to the BBC that all internet service providers had been directed to open access to YouTube. The Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd posted on its Facebook page on Monday: \"Welcome Back YouTube\". Pakistan's ministry of information technology said: \"Google has provided an online web process through which requests for blocking access of offending material can be made by the PTA to Google directly. \"Google/YouTube will accordingly restrict access to the said offending material for users within Pakistan.\" However, a YouTube spokeswoman said government requests for the removal of content would not automatically be granted. \"We have clear community guidelines, and when videos violate those rules, we remove them,\" she said. \"In addition, where we have launched YouTube locally and we are notified that a video is illegal in that country, we may restrict access to it after a thorough review.\" She said requests by governments for content to be removed would be recorded in YouTube's Transparency Report. Pakistan's ban on YouTube was imposed by the Supreme Court in 2012 after the US-made film Innocence of Muslims was uploaded.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Media playback is not supported on this device Doull emulated fellow Welshman Geraint Thomas, who won at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, by helping Great Britain win team pursuit gold in world record time. The 23-year-old joined record-breaking Sir Bradley Wiggins, Steven Burke and Ed Clancy to beat the world champions. \"That was just surreal, it feels dreamlike\" said the Cardiff rider. Media playback is not supported on this device \"We've been in situations like that before when we've been so close and have lost so to pull it off now is unbelievable.\" He had previously won silver medals at the 2015 and 2016 World Championship - this year to the Australian team - but Doull earned Olympic redemption to add to the four Welsh silver medallists in Rio. \"I've dreamt of this moment for so long,\" added Doull. \"It's what gets you out of the bed in the morning. I've pictured crossing that line first and winning the Olympics and to finally be here and do it, it's just surreal. It's a culmination of four years of hard work.\" Swimmer Jazz Carlin, rower Victoria Thornley and rugby sevens players Sam Cross and James Davies had already enjoyed podium finishes before Doull secured Wales' seventh gold in the last three Olympics. Wales had not won an Olympic title in 36 years when Nicole Cooke stormed to women's road race gold in 2008 - the first Welsh cycling medal ever at an Olympics. But since Cooke's win in Beijing, Wales have won three more cycling gold medals - and could win a fifth on Saturday when Elinor Barker will help the British world record holding women bid for team pursuit gold. Doull - who started cycling at the Maindy Fliers club in Cardiff like Thomas and Barker - had helped the Great Britain team to lower the world record in their heat demolition of New Zealand. But Team GB were quickly behind in Friday's final as Australia led by 0.7 seconds at the halfway mark, before GB reeled them in and then pulled away in the final 500m to win the 4km race by 0.83 seconds - in a world record time of three minutes, 50.265 seconds. Doull's team-mate Wiggins became the first Briton to win eight Olympic medals - five golds, one silver and two bronzes - as GB won a third successive team pursuit Olympic title. \"It gives you such confidence....you've got Brad on my right behind me and I've got Burke and Ed down below me,\" said Doull. \"It's Burke's second Olympic title in his discipline, it's Ed's third and he's the most decorated Yorkshireman, so he keeps telling me, so to have that calibre of team is just massive and it gives you such confidence.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Owain Doull has won Wales' first gold of the 2016 Olympics as  he helped the Great Britain men's team pursuit defend their cycling title in Rio.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nGreat Britain's Bradley Wiggins has won the gold medal in the men's time trial at the Rio Olympics.\n\nWhat is the most important information I should know about Bradley Wiggins?\n\nBradley Wiggins is a British cyclist who won the 2012 Tour de France.\n\nWhat is Bradley Wiggins's background?", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "Great", "\u0120Britain", "'s", "\u0120Bradley", "\u0120Wiggins", "\u0120has", "\u0120won", "\u0120the", "\u0120gold", "\u0120medal", "\u0120in", "\u0120the", "\u0120men", "'s", "\u0120time", "\u0120trial", "\u0120at", "\u0120the", "\u0120Rio", "\u0120Olympics", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "What", "\u0120is", "\u0120the", "\u0120most", "\u0120important", "\u0120information", "\u0120I", "\u0120should", "\u0120know", "\u0120about", "\u0120Bradley", "\u0120Wiggins", "?", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Brad", "ley", "\u0120Wiggins", "\u0120is", "\u0120a", "\u0120British", "\u0120cyclist", "\u0120who", "\u0120won", "\u0120the", "\u01202012", "\u0120Tour", "\u0120de", "\u0120France", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "What", "\u0120is", "\u0120Bradley", "\u0120Wiggins", "'s", "\u0120background", "?", "\u010a"], "token_logprobs": [-2.6226043701171875e-06, -0.79248046875, 0.0, -0.20751953125, -1.3173828125, 0.0, -0.3720703125, -0.0013580322265625, -0.39111328125, -0.367919921875, -6.61611557006836e-05, -0.0011444091796875, -0.00011527538299560547, -0.005847930908203125, -2.384185791015625e-06, -0.609375, -6.818771362304688e-05, -0.00521087646484375, -8.344650268554688e-06, -0.006328582763671875, -0.0193939208984375, -0.00556182861328125, -0.018280029296875, 0.0, -0.065673828125, -0.0970458984375, -0.0016050338745117188, -0.73193359375, -0.057708740234375, -0.7607421875, -0.83935546875, -0.0006957054138183594, -0.00038814544677734375, -0.033843994140625, -0.001453399658203125, 0.0, -3.5762786865234375e-05, -5.125999450683594e-06, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -0.07562255859375, 0.0, -2.384185791015625e-07, -0.01953125, -0.02154541015625, -0.026885986328125, -0.0024471282958984375, -0.03143310546875, -0.60986328125, -0.0280914306640625, -0.86962890625, -0.00806427001953125, -1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.0, -0.394287109375, -0.4296875, 0.0, -0.0567626953125, -0.011871337890625, -0.07464599609375, 0.0, -0.4365234375, -0.77978515625, -0.00010776519775390625, -2.86102294921875e-06], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": -2.86102294921875e-06, "Great": -0.79248046875, "\u0120Britain": 0.0, "'s": -0.4365234375, "\u0120Bradley": -0.07464599609375, "\u0120Wiggins": 0.0, "\u0120has": -0.3720703125, "\u0120won": -0.60986328125, "\u0120the": -0.0280914306640625, "\u0120gold": -0.367919921875, "\u0120medal": -6.61611557006836e-05, "\u0120in": -0.0011444091796875, "\u0120men": -0.005847930908203125, "\u0120time": -0.609375, "\u0120trial": -6.818771362304688e-05, "\u0120at": -0.00521087646484375, "\u0120Rio": -0.006328582763671875, "\u0120Olympics": -0.0193939208984375, ".": -0.394287109375, "What": -0.0567626953125, "\u0120is": -0.011871337890625, "\u0120most": -0.73193359375, "\u0120important": -0.057708740234375, "\u0120information": -0.7607421875, "\u0120I": -0.83935546875, "\u0120should": -0.0006957054138183594, "\u0120know": -0.00038814544677734375, "\u0120about": -0.033843994140625, "?": -0.00010776519775390625, "Brad": -0.07562255859375, "ley": 0.0, "\u0120a": -0.02154541015625, "\u0120British": -0.026885986328125, "\u0120cyclist": -0.0024471282958984375, "\u0120who": -0.03143310546875, "\u01202012": -0.86962890625, "\u0120Tour": -0.00806427001953125, "\u0120de": -1.1920928955078125e-07, "\u0120France": 0.0, "\u0120background": -0.77978515625}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Bridget and Jonathan Reid, from Moy, near Tomatin in the Highlands, tied the knot at Nevis Range, near Fort William, on Friday. The couple first's date six years ago was a skiing trip, so they decided it would be appropriate to get married on skis. Adventure photographer Hamish Frost took their wedding snaps. Bridget, who is a teacher, and Jonathan, who runs his own electrical automation company, benefited from recent snowfalls for their big day. They got married in full Highland dress, which includes a kilt, and white wedding dress surrounded by snow-covered mountain landscape. The white stuff had been lacking over winter, but last month's Storm Doris and recent spells of colder weather have helped with the operation of Nevis Range and Scotland's other outdoor ski centres. The newly weds said: \"Over the last couple of years we have spent as many weekends as possible skiing the Back Corries at Nevis Range. \"We love the atmosphere, the friendliness of the staff and the amazing terrain for skiing.  When we heard that we could actually get married there it was a no-brainer.\" The couple got married at the top of Easy Gully in a ceremony officiated by Halde Pottinger from the Humanist Society of Scotland. \"He was totally up for marrying us on skis and did an amazing job. He is currently trying to establish whether or not we are the first wedding actually conducted and vowed in skis - officiate and couple,\" said the Reids. \"We can't actually believe we are but there can't be many. We also managed to twist the arm of adventure photographer Hamish Frost, who came along to take photographs.\" The couple added: \"The day could not have been better. Without doubt it was the best conditions of the year - with blue skies and fresh snow, we could not have asked for more.\" They thanked the staff of Nevis Range for \"a fabulous job making our day possible\", and for helping in throwing \"a hell of a good party\" in the evening.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "All images copyrighted.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nA couple skis down the mountain in their wedding attire.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "A", "\u0120couple", "\u0120sk", "is", "\u0120down", "\u0120the", "\u0120mountain", "\u0120in", "\u0120their", "\u0120wedding", "\u0120attire", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###"], "token_logprobs": [-1.0371208190917969e-05, -0.39892578125, -0.108154296875, -0.70263671875, -0.11962890625, -0.0014181137084960938, -0.1746826171875, -0.53173828125, -0.00693511962890625, -0.004055023193359375, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -0.638671875, -0.0010900497436523438, -0.003383636474609375, -7.259845733642578e-05, -0.004032135009765625, -8.463859558105469e-05, -3.337860107421875e-06, -0.012542724609375, -4.76837158203125e-07, -2.9802322387695312e-06, -0.0007123947143554688, -1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.0, -0.00018537044525146484, -1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.0, -4.982948303222656e-05, -2.384185791015625e-07, 0.0, -2.4318695068359375e-05, -1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.0, -2.3603439331054688e-05, -1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.0, -1.728534698486328e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -1.2636184692382812e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -7.3909759521484375e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -4.0531158447265625e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -2.5033950805664062e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -1.9073486328125e-06, -1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.0, -1.9073486328125e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -2.0265579223632812e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -1.7881393432617188e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -1.3113021850585938e-06], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": 0.0, "A": -0.39892578125, "\u0120couple": -0.108154296875, "\u0120sk": -0.70263671875, "is": -0.11962890625, "\u0120down": -0.0014181137084960938, "\u0120the": -0.1746826171875, "\u0120mountain": -0.53173828125, "\u0120in": -0.00693511962890625, "\u0120their": -0.004055023193359375, "\u0120wedding": -1.1920928955078125e-07, "\u0120attire": -0.638671875, ".": -0.0010900497436523438, "###": -1.3113021850585938e-06}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}
{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: The fine follows the conviction of former RBS trader, Shirlina Tsang, for fraud last year. She was sentenced to 50 months in prison after being caught falsifying records of emerging markets trades. Hong Kong regulators said RBS's controls were \"seriously inadequate\". The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) also said there were \"significant weaknesses in its procedures, management systems and internal controls.\" But the regulator said the fine took into account the bank's speedy action in alerting the authorities once it had discovered the illegal trades, which took place in its emerging markets rates business in 2011. \"This deserves substantial credit and is the reason why today's sanctions are not heavier ones,\" Mark Steward, the SFC's head of enforcement, said in a statement. RBS responded with a statement, reading: \"We put in place a comprehensive remediation programme that strengthened our governance and supervisory oversight, and our control environment.\" The fine is relatively small compared to others the bank has received in the last few years. In December RBS agreed to pay 391m euros (\u00a3320m) in penalties to the European Commission for its role in the attempted rigging of Yen Libor and Euribor - the Tokyo and euro equivalents of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. In the same month it was fined $100m (\u00a360m) by US regulators for violations of US sanctions against Iran, Sudan, Burma, and Cuba. The bank was found to have removed location information on payments made to US financial institutions from countries such as Iran and Cuba.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has been fined HK$6m (\u00a3460,000) by Hong Kong regulators after it failed to detect a series of unauthorised transactions by one of its traders.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nRBS fined \u00a31.1bn for Libor rigging\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "R", "BS", "\u0120fined", "\u0120\u00c2\u00a3", "1", ".", "1", "bn", "\u0120for", "\u0120Lib", "or", "\u0120rigging", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Article", ":", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "\u0120fine", "\u0120is", "\u0120the", "\u0120largest", "\u0120ever", "\u0120imposed", "\u0120by", "\u0120the", "\u0120S", "FO", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Sum", "mar", "ize", "\u0120the", "\u0120above", "\u0120article", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "R", "BS", "\u0120fined", "\u0120\u00c2\u00a3", "1", ".", "1", "bn", "\u0120for", "\u0120Lib", "or", "\u0120rigging", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Article", ":"], "token_logprobs": [-0.0001188516616821289, -0.1116943359375, 0.0, -0.0014410018920898438, -0.91650390625, -1.3291015625, -0.0150604248046875, -0.053375244140625, -0.082275390625, -0.0142974853515625, -0.046844482421875, 0.0, -0.149169921875, -0.092041015625, -5.960464477539062e-07, -0.1156005859375, -5.8650970458984375e-05, -0.0007557868957519531, -0.14453125, -1.1324882507324219e-05, -0.0513916015625, -1.1920928955078125e-06, -0.58203125, -0.0012102127075195312, -0.1495361328125, -0.044769287109375, -0.578125, -0.003620147705078125, -0.0794677734375, -0.35400390625, -0.10369873046875, -0.0665283203125, -0.089111328125, -0.84619140625, -0.004436492919921875, -9.059906005859375e-06, -0.52099609375, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00011420249938964844, -0.61279296875, -0.186767578125, -0.01195526123046875, -4.76837158203125e-07, 0.0, -0.04638671875, 0.0, -0.0006608963012695312, -0.0006198883056640625, -0.0005879402160644531, -0.07891845703125, -0.04248046875, -0.0013360977172851562, -0.006389617919921875, -0.018768310546875, 0.0, -3.3736228942871094e-05, -0.0003592967987060547, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -1.1444091796875e-05, -2.0265579223632812e-06, -1.5854835510253906e-05, -0.078125, -4.172325134277344e-05], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": -1.5854835510253906e-05, "R": -0.04638671875, "BS": 0.0, "\u0120fined": -0.0006608963012695312, "\u0120\u00c2\u00a3": -0.0006198883056640625, "1": -0.04248046875, ".": -0.07891845703125, "bn": -0.0013360977172851562, "\u0120for": -0.006389617919921875, "\u0120Lib": -0.018768310546875, "or": 0.0, "\u0120rigging": -3.3736228942871094e-05, "###": -1.1444091796875e-05, "Article": -0.078125, ":": -4.172325134277344e-05, "The": -0.58203125, "\u0120fine": -0.0012102127075195312, "\u0120is": -0.1495361328125, "\u0120the": -0.00011420249938964844, "\u0120largest": -0.578125, "\u0120ever": -0.003620147705078125, "\u0120imposed": -0.0794677734375, "\u0120by": -0.35400390625, "\u0120S": -0.0665283203125, "FO": -0.089111328125, "Sum": -0.52099609375, "mar": 0.0, "ize": 0.0, "\u0120above": -0.61279296875, "\u0120article": -0.186767578125}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}
{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Here are the best bits we heard backstage at the Royal Albert Hall in London. In La La Land, Emma Stone plays aspiring actress Mia Dolan. So does the best actress winner think Mia could ever win a Bafta or Oscar? After a dramatic pause, she delivered her verdict. \"Hopefully!\" \"It's been like a whirlwind,\" said Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, winner of the Rising Star Award. \"I'm so happy everything seems to be working out.\" The 20-year-old Brit isn't wrong there. Having made his screen debut in tsunami disaster movie The Impossible, he first appeared as Spidey in Captain America: Civil War and recently finished filming for Spider-Man: Homecoming. But Tom admitted the super hero role has its drawbacks. \"Ever since I was a kid I've wanted to be Spider-Man. It's been so fun, but my legs are in bits right now from spider poses after spider poses. \"So I'll be sitting down for the rest of the evening!\" It was perhaps inevitable that Meryl Streep's speech at the Golden Globes would come up at the Baftas. Asked about Donald Trump's response, supporting actress winner Viola Davis didn't hold back. \"Anyone who labels Meryl Streep an 'overrated' actress obviously doesn't know anything about acting,\" she said. \"That's not just directed towards Donald Trump - that's directed towards anyone.\" She didn't stop there. \"This is someone who is the master at her skill and she has lasted for 40 years in a very difficult profession,\" Viola continued. \"One of the things people have to know about this woman is that she is the most honourable, accessible human being you could possibly want to meet.\" Best actor winner Casey Affleck said he'd grabbed a word with Meryl Streep after the Baftas ceremony. \"She was taking pictures of people... and I told her how much her speech at the Golden Globes meant to all of us and how grateful I was that she did it and kicked in the door a little bit,\" he said. The Manchester by the Sea star said he hoped more actors would speak out. \"There is a big audience for these awards shows... and I have to say I'm very proud to be a part of the arts community. \"I don't always say some of the things I would like to say in those opportunities because there are people like Meryl Streep who say them much better than I can - and if they are going to be said it should be said very, very well because they are important.\" \"I'm a little bit wobbly,\" confessed Dev Patel a few minutes after winning the supporting actor prize for Lion. \"I really did not expect it, we have gone to so many awards ceremony and this one is where everything changed, on home turf with my family.\" Dev recalled how he had made his acting debut a decade ago on E4's teen drama Skins. \"I remember the first time I ever stepped on a film set, I never knew what a boom mic was,\" he laughed. \"My mum took me to an open casting of Skins after she saw an advert in Metro newspaper and 10 years on we are here at the Baftas - that is pretty amazing.\" Justin Hurwitz, who won the Bafta for his original music in La La Land, said that he'd written a title song that didn't end up in the movie. \"It was going to be in the middle of the movie but we nixed that, and then we toyed with using it in the end credits, and we nixed that at the last minute.\" And how about this? Another Day of Sun, from the famous traffic jam scene, was cut \"for many months\" before being put back in as the big opening number. Mel Brooks, who was awarded the prestigious Bafta Fellowship, was asked about whether he might write a comedy about Donald Trump. \"I'm not afraid of him, I don't think he's dangerous,\" said the 90-year-old writer, actor and producer. \"I think he's mostly an entertainer, a guy who wants audiences to love him. \"What I'm afraid of are all the guys around him, the people who whisper in his ears, like the people who whispered in George W Bush's ears and we got the Iraq War... \"I just hope that Trump stays the egomaniac he is, listens to no-one and then we'll all be safe. But if he believes these guys we're all in trouble.\" Mel was in a lighter mood as he plugged his new musical Young Frankenstein, which will open in London's West End this year after a run in Newcastle. \"I think, modestly speaking, it will be sensational,\" he chuckled.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Media playback is not supported on this device Of his first 30 matches in 2017, the world number one has won 21 and lost nine. Winning his last five tournaments of 2016 to pip Novak Djokovic to the year-end number one position in the final match of the season at London's O2 Arena was astonishing, dramatic and unforgettable. And yet it appears that relentless run of success, and the 87 matches he played over a season, has come at a price. Murray's straight-set defeat by world number 90 Jordan Thompson in the first round at Queen's Club was the sixth time he has lost to a player outside the top 20 this year. He has had shingles and an elbow problem, and now his left hip is proving cause for concern. Opting out of two scheduled exhibition matches at the Hurlingham Club in London may not be too much of a blow, as Murray's aptitude for grass is likely to allow him some margin for error during the opening week at Wimbledon. But will he be in pain, and will his movement suffer? Although it was reassuring to see him return to the practice courts on Friday, Murray was walking with a limp and neither moving, nor hitting his backhand, anywhere near as well as he will need to. Only time will tell. Media playback is not supported on this device Murray has looked especially vulnerable this season over three sets. As well as the defeat by Thompson at Queen's, he has also lost in straight sets to Fabio Fognini in Rome (no disgrace), to Borna Coric in Madrid, and to world number 129 Vasek Pospisil at Indian Wells. Though he was bamboozled by Mischa Zverev in the fourth round of the Australian Open, his Grand Slam record remains formidable. He is aiming this fortnight for a 10th consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final, and the last time he failed to reach the second week of a Slam was when he fell to Stan Wawrinka in the third round of the 2010 US Open. So, assuming Murray's hip does not leave him underpowered, the French Open provides the best indication as to how he might fare at Wimbledon. Murray often started slowly in matches at Roland Garros, but put in a dominant third-round performance against Juan Martin del Potro as he won in straight sets. He never looked a realistic champion, but ultimately was just a tie-break away from a second consecutive final. He then ran out of steam, a legacy of insufficient matches, in a Stan Wawrinka-dominated final set of their semi-final. It would be foolish to try to come to a firm conclusion about Murray's chances at the All England Club this year. Twice a champion, and a gold-medal winner on Centre Court at the 2012 Olympics, not even Novak Djokovic has outperformed him at Wimbledon over the past five years. Yet on 2017 results alone, Murray is only the seventh best player in the field. He has too frequently struggled to impose himself on his opponent, and hindered at times by injury, has not been able to trust his serve in the same way. This year he has won 72% of points on first serve, down from 76% last year; and while last year he saved 66% of the break points he faced, that number has fallen this year to 54%. He claims his indifferent form is nothing to do with the pressure associated with his status as world number one, and he does not cut the figure of a man weighed down by an unwelcome burden. But perhaps Murray has lost his cause: he is now the hunted, rather than the hunter. That may not be a concern much longer. Murray is virtually 5,000 points behind Rafael Nadal in the season-long race and is therefore very likely to be replaced at the top of the rankings by the autumn at the latest. In fact, he could be overtaken after Wimbledon by Wawrinka or Djokovic if they win the title, but more probably by Nadal, who assuming both reach the second week would only have to go one round further. Nadal's knees, Djokovic's blues and Wawrinka's unexceptional Wimbledon record muddy the waters still further. And then there's Roger Federer: the seven-time champion, who is free of injuries, and last Sunday in Halle won his fourth title of the year having skipped the clay-court season.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Manor's operating company Just Racing Services has been in administration since 6 January, and FRP Advisory has been unable to find a buyer. Just Racing ceased trading on Friday, effectively ending the Manor team. The staff were sent home on Friday and told they will be made redundant by the close of business on Tuesday after the payment of January salaries. FRP said there was \"no sustainable operational or financial structure in place to maintain the group as a going concern\". Joint administrator Geoff Rowley added the administration process \"provided a moratorium\" in the search for a buyer but \"no solution could be achieved to allow for the business to continue in its current form\". It is not necessarily the end of Manor - a buyer could potentially still purchase the remnants of the team. But even if that were to happen, the move makes it much harder for Manor to make it to the start of the season in Australia on 26 March. The team's collapse leaves 10 teams - 20 cars - on the grid in Melbourne and comes just five days after the sport was taken over by US company Liberty Media and long-time commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone was removed as chief executive. Media playback is not supported on this device Manor started life as Virgin Racing in 2010 and has been through several guises in the intervening seven years. It previously went into administration in October 2014, and was only saved by current owner Stephen Fitzpatrick, the boss of energy firm Ovo, on the eve of the 2015 season. Fitzpatrick has said the decisive moment was the team's slip to 11th place in the constructors' championship as a result of Sauber's Felipe Nasr finishing ninth in the penultimate race of last season in Brazil. This cost the team in the region of $15m (\u00a312m) in prize money. Manor were one of three new teams to enter F1 in 2010 after they were promised by then FIA president Max Mosley that a \u00a340m budget cap would be introduced. But Mosley stood down as head of the governing body in 2009 after losing a fight with the teams over the plan and the cost limit was abandoned. All three teams have now collapsed. This content will not work on your device, please check Javascript and cookies are enabled or update your browser Anneliese Dodds MEP has called for a European Commission investigation into the FIA and F1 following Manor's collapse. She said: \"The collapse of Manor Racing could be the end of seven turbulent years for a team that brought highly skilled jobs to Oxfordshire. I am very concerned that this follows other job losses in small teams. \"Formula One Group, its owners and the FIA as a regulator really need to be investigated after this collapse. \"The unfair way in which prize money is allocated in the sport, permanently favouring the largest teams regardless of their finishing position, has seen many teams struggle to survive and ultimately reduced the number of cars on the grid. \"The European Commission must investigate the complaints it received last year from two F1 teams related to anti-competitive practices before even more highly skilled jobs are lost both in the South East and all around Europe. \"I will be writing to the Commission to call on them to take serious action on the way F1 is run, before a sport loved by 500 million fans is damaged beyond repair.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The Manor team have collapsed after administrators failed to find a buyer for the stricken business.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nManor's operating company FRP Advisory has been appointed administrator of the Manor Racing Team.\n\nWhat does this mean for Manor?\n\nThe team has been placed into administration, which is a form of bankruptcy protection.\n\nAdministrators will now try to find a buyer for the team.\n\nI", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "Man", "or", "'s", "\u0120operating", "\u0120company", "\u0120FR", "P", "\u0120Advisory", "\u0120has", "\u0120been", "\u0120appointed", "\u0120administrator", "\u0120of", "\u0120the", "\u0120Manor", "\u0120Racing", "\u0120Team", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "What", "\u0120does", "\u0120this", "\u0120mean", "\u0120for", "\u0120Manor", "?", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "\u0120team", "\u0120has", "\u0120been", "\u0120placed", "\u0120into", "\u0120administration", ",", "\u0120which", "\u0120is", "\u0120a", "\u0120form", "\u0120of", "\u0120bankruptcy", "\u0120protection", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Administ", "rators", "\u0120will", "\u0120now", "\u0120try", "\u0120to", "\u0120find", "\u0120a", "\u0120buyer", "\u0120for", "\u0120the", "\u0120team", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "If"], "token_logprobs": [-3.5762786865234375e-07, -0.4462890625, 0.0, -0.310302734375, -0.0013828277587890625, -1.0967254638671875e-05, -0.4892578125, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -0.30517578125, -0.04107666015625, -0.014617919921875, -0.728515625, -0.118408203125, -0.0225372314453125, -0.67626953125, -0.05517578125, -0.35546875, -0.07537841796875, -0.0584716796875, 0.0, -0.023345947265625, -0.36083984375, -0.1474609375, -1.6689300537109375e-06, -0.1280517578125, -0.254150390625, -0.03948974609375, -4.291534423828125e-06, 0.0, -0.321044921875, -0.00843048095703125, -1.19921875, -0.0166015625, -0.400634765625, -0.21923828125, -8.344650268554688e-07, -0.6748046875, -0.26171875, -0.43017578125, -0.11859130859375, -0.385986328125, -8.344650268554688e-07, -0.31298828125, -0.44091796875, -0.025634765625, -0.484375, 0.0, -0.135498046875, -0.0118865966796875, -0.268798828125, -0.0113525390625, -0.853515625, -0.0034885406494140625, -0.259033203125, -0.0002206563949584961, -4.839897155761719e-05, -0.00029540061950683594, -0.0032787322998046875, -0.0012416839599609375, -0.096923828125, -0.00036787986755371094, 0.0, -0.05474853515625], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": 0.0, "Man": -0.4462890625, "or": 0.0, "'s": -0.310302734375, "\u0120operating": -0.0013828277587890625, "\u0120company": -1.0967254638671875e-05, "\u0120FR": -0.4892578125, "P": -1.1920928955078125e-07, "\u0120Advisory": -1.1920928955078125e-07, "\u0120has": -1.19921875, "\u0120been": -0.0166015625, "\u0120appointed": -0.014617919921875, "\u0120administrator": -0.728515625, "\u0120of": -8.344650268554688e-07, "\u0120the": -0.0032787322998046875, "\u0120Manor": -0.254150390625, "\u0120Racing": -0.05517578125, "\u0120Team": -0.35546875, ".": -0.096923828125, "What": -0.023345947265625, "\u0120does": -0.36083984375, "\u0120this": -0.1474609375, "\u0120mean": -1.6689300537109375e-06, "\u0120for": -0.00029540061950683594, "?": -0.03948974609375, "The": -0.321044921875, "\u0120team": -0.0012416839599609375, "\u0120placed": -0.400634765625, "\u0120into": -0.21923828125, "\u0120administration": -8.344650268554688e-07, ",": -0.6748046875, "\u0120which": -0.26171875, "\u0120is": -0.43017578125, "\u0120a": -0.0002206563949584961, "\u0120form": -0.385986328125, "\u0120bankruptcy": -0.31298828125, "\u0120protection": -0.44091796875, "Administ": -0.135498046875, "rators": -0.0118865966796875, "\u0120will": -0.268798828125, "\u0120now": -0.0113525390625, "\u0120try": -0.853515625, "\u0120to": -0.0034885406494140625, "\u0120find": -0.259033203125, "\u0120buyer": -4.839897155761719e-05, "If": -0.05474853515625}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The outcome of that could make a considerable difference to the exchange rate. \"You do not necessarily have to put all your eggs in one basket - there is also the option to hedge your bets and buy half of your dollars now and half of them just before you go, as long as you are not going to be hit by extra charges for carrying out two transactions. \"It is always worth shopping around when buying currency - avoid buying your currency at the last minute at the airport. There are plenty of comparison sites online that will help you get the most dollars possible for your pounds, even if it is fewer than you would have got a few months ago.\" We asked readers to send in questions about the recent fall of the pound and rise of the FTSE 100.

The National Museum of the Royal Navy has started consulting over a proposed move to Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. Campaigners insist it is a local memorial to the conflict and \"belongs\" at Eastney. The Yomper statue was created by Philip Jackson, depicting a royal marine marching across the islands during the 1982 conflict and was unveiled by former prime minister, Lady Thatcher, in 1992. The National Museum of the Royal Navy (NMRN) is planning to relocate the Royal Marines Museum from Eastney to Portsmouth Historic Dockyard as part of a \u00c2\u00a313m lottery funded project and wants to take the statue with it. An online petition against moving the statue has attracted more than 1,800 signatories, saying it was \"now considered as our local Falklands War Memorial\". Sheila Mackie who set it up said: \"The imposing scale of The Yomper needs space and adequate distance to be fully appreciated, and the visualization of the part in the major campaign that the statue represents couldn't be achieved in an interior space.\" Conservative-led Portsmouth City Council also voted to express a \"clear preference\" that the statue remain where it it is. Its motion stated: \"The Yomper statue has graced the seafront for many years, serving as a reminder of both the Falklands War and of the Marines' historical association with Eastney.\" NMRN director Jon Rawlinson said the new museum site would potentially have 750,000 visitors a year, compared to 40,000 at the current museum. \"He would be seen by far more people at the historic dockyard, but of course he was built for here [Eastney] and is part of here. \" He said no decision had been made and it would consider all comments submitted to its public consultation.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Plans to move a statue depicting a Royal Marine in the Falklands conflict away from Portsmouth seafront have been criticised.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Yom Kippur War was the first major conflict of the Cold War.\n\nWhat is the name of the statue?\n\nThe Yom Kippur War Memorial.\n\nWhat is the name of the statue?\n\nThe Yom Kippur War Memorial.\n\nWhat i", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "The", "\u0120Y", "om", "\u0120K", "ipp", "ur", "\u0120War", "\u0120was", "\u0120the", "\u0120first", "\u0120major", "\u0120conflict", "\u0120of", "\u0120the", "\u0120Cold", "\u0120War", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "What", "\u0120is", "\u0120the", "\u0120name", "\u0120of", "\u0120the", "\u0120statue", "?", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "\u0120Y", "om", "\u0120K", "ipp", "ur", "\u0120War", "\u0120Memorial", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "What", "\u0120is", "\u0120the", "\u0120name", "\u0120of", "\u0120the", "\u0120statue", "?", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "\u0120Y", "om", "\u0120K", "ipp", "ur", "\u0120War", "\u0120Memorial", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "What", "\u0120is"], "token_logprobs": [-0.0001380443572998047, -0.006145477294921875, -0.1553955078125, -5.602836608886719e-06, -1.800060272216797e-05, 0.0, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -0.0016498565673828125, -0.892578125, -0.1754150390625, -0.82470703125, -1.2080078125, -0.169677734375, -0.094970703125, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -0.0083770751953125, 0.0, -0.14697265625, -0.0916748046875, 0.0, -1.189453125, -0.07440185546875, -0.0007619857788085938, -0.90576171875, -3.5762786865234375e-07, -0.0002639293670654297, -0.0028400421142578125, -0.0240020751953125, -2.4557113647460938e-05, -4.76837158203125e-07, -0.01313018798828125, -0.01187896728515625, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0004355907440185547, -0.0013685226440429688, -0.2239990234375, -9.465217590332031e-05, 0.0, -0.06463623046875, -0.0017309188842773438, -4.684925079345703e-05, -0.377685546875, 0.0, -3.5762786865234375e-07, -0.021453857421875, -0.01334381103515625, -7.152557373046875e-07, 0.0, -0.022552490234375, -0.00027489662170410156, -3.814697265625e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -5.960464477539062e-07, -2.968311309814453e-05, -0.0271453857421875, -1.3113021850585938e-06, 0.0, -0.09942626953125, -0.0016508102416992188], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": 0.0, "The": -0.022552490234375, "\u0120Y": -0.00027489662170410156, "om": -3.814697265625e-06, "\u0120K": 0.0, "ipp": 0.0, "ur": 0.0, "\u0120War": -5.960464477539062e-07, "\u0120was": -0.892578125, "\u0120the": -3.5762786865234375e-07, "\u0120first": -0.82470703125, "\u0120major": -1.2080078125, "\u0120conflict": -0.169677734375, "\u0120of": 0.0, "\u0120Cold": -0.0083770751953125, ".": -0.0271453857421875, "What": -0.09942626953125, "\u0120is": -0.0016508102416992188, "\u0120name": -0.377685546875, "\u0120statue": -0.021453857421875, "?": -0.01334381103515625, "\u0120Memorial": -2.968311309814453e-05}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}
{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: It is believed to be the first alleged breach of the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPim). The suspect appeared at the Old Bailey accused of failing to contact a monitoring company and report to a police station twice in January. The Home Office has refused to comment on the case. TPims replaced control orders in January 2012. The suspect - who can only be referred to as BM - was one of nine British citizens subject to a TPim when the figures were last disclosed in March. The BBC is not aware of anyone else who has appeared in court charged with a breach of a TPim. The Home Office said: \"We do not comment on individual cases.  The police investigate all breaches of TPims and will prosecute where that is viable.\" Those subject to a TPim can be ordered to stay overnight at a specified address and report to a police station every day. Other measures include a ban on contacting particular individuals, going to certain areas and places and travelling abroad. Labour has argued that TPims have \"weakened\" public protection against terrorism. In March, the independent reviewer of terror laws, David Anderson, said TPims could prove less effective than control orders because they can be imposed for a maximum period of two years only. The court heard that BM is charged with two counts of breaching Section 23 of a TPim order. The allegations are that on 16 January he failed to contact a monitoring company, and on 27 January failed to report to a police station. BM, who has a grey beard and was dressed for the hearing in a white shirt, cannot be named nor have his address published for legal reasons. The prosecutor Louise Gray asked for a provisional date of 2 July to be set for a plea and case management hearing. The defendant was granted unconditional bail although he remains subject to the restrictions imposed by his TPim.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: But the latest Cinderella is bucking the trend - and seemingly appealing to audiences as a result. Directed by Sir Kenneth Branagh, Cinderella is a live-action version of Disney's classic 1950 animation that has taken $70m (\u00c2\u00a343.1m) on its opening weekend in the United States. Yet this adaptation is completely faithful to the traditional story - including wicked stepmother, fairy godmother, glass slipper, handsome prince and happy ending. British actress Lily James, best known as Lady Rose from ITV's Downton Abbey, stars as Cinderella. Cate Blanchett plays the stepmother and Helena Bonham Carter is the fairy godmother. \"Keeping it classic is the twist,\" says Branagh, who started his directing career in 1989 with his adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry V. \"I always felt that it's better to do a modern version of a story using the historical perspective, than say, make a story of Cinderella in Brooklyn in 2015. \"I find that when you try and update Shakespeare to a contemporary setting too, you always pay a price. \"In this case, the original material of Cinderella is far richer than my ideas, so it seems to me that it's my job to make it simple. Just let the fairytale speak, because it affects us in a more complicated way than we think. \"Audiences have already come up to me saying the film is about patchwork families, about child bereavement, about the politics between women these days. Fairytales are a psychological brain-worm that need to be left alone to do their work.\" Helena Bonham Carter says that at first she was dubious \"as to whether a straight version would work\". \"I think it's a really good film, but it could so easily have been bad. I was saying: 'So you're really going to do a completely straight version of Cinderella? No gimmicks, no extra frills, no 3D?' \"It's very classic, but they know me, and they allowed me not to be that straight in my own role.\" Just as audiences seem to have taken to the film, critics such as the Guardian's Guy Lodge comment that \"while it might have been nice to see the new-model Cinderella follow Frozen's progressive, quasi-feminist lead, the film's naff, preserved-in-amber romanticism is its very charm\". But James disagrees that this Cinderella is an old-fashioned heroine, pointing out that at the start of Disney's 1950 classic, Cinderella \"is staring out of the window dreaming of the prince and waiting for him to rescue her\". \"This Cinderella doesn't do that at all. I think we make it very clear that everything she does is her choice - even deciding to stay on at her parents' house with such wicked treatment from her stepmother. \"She is told by her dying mother to 'have courage and be kind' and this is the film's, and Cinderella's, backbone.\" This is the first major leading role for Surrey-born James. \"Not even a big TV series like Downton could prepare me for this fuss,\" she says. \"I am getting slightly carried away. I keep seeing giant posters of me all over the place in a big blue dress and people shouting my name. \"I'm trying to enjoy the magic actually - this is the fairytale aspect of it for me, personally. It's quite something that so many little girls are going to think I'm Cinderella.\" James has dismissed speculation that her waist had been digitally altered to make it smaller as \"irrelevant\", claiming that fans were interested in Cinderella because of her \"morals\". Cate Blanchett agrees that the core of the film is \"kindness\", adding that it is \"an unusual quality these days. There's not a cynical bone in this film's body and that's its strength. \"There is cruelty and jealousy in the movie too, but too often we don't value kindness. In today's world you think someone who is kind is a doormat, and the fact this triumphs is really heart-warming.\" Branagh, who previously directed Marvel's Thor, describes kindness \"as its own super-power.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: But one nation, Russia, was missing. For the first time in Eurovision history, the host nation barred another country's singer. That is because in 2015, in violation of Ukrainian border rules, Russia's Julia Samoilova performed in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia a year earlier. Samoilova suffers from a neural muscular disorder and has used a wheelchair since childhood. \"When the rumours began I might not go, I was so sad,\" she told the BBC in Moscow. \"I thought, how come? This was my dream. When the final decision was taken I didn't believe it. But unfortunately, this is the reality.\" \"I think it's a stupid reaction,\" Russian MP Vitaly Milonov tells me. \"They're even afraid of such a small girl to enter Kiev.\" Even before Ukraine's ban, Mr Milonov had called for a Russian boycott of Eurovision: \"Eurovision became a disgusting socialist nightmare for all these left-wing parties with all their bearded women, or men, with these anti-Christian positions. \"I am sure that most conservatives in the world will never attend this festival. Because this is a festival of Sodom and Gomorrah.\" It is supposed to be a festival of peace and friendship but there is not much sign of either in relations between Kiev and Moscow. In eastern Ukraine, 10,000 people have been killed in three years of war: a war in which Russia is directly involved through its military support for separatist rebels. Crimea remains a source of tension and Eurovision is the latest battleground. \"Since 2014, we've had a law in Ukraine that punishes people who illegally cross our border when they visit Crimea,\" says Ukrainian MP Olha Chervakova. \"Did Russia know this? Of course. Did Russia know that Julia Samoilova would fall foul of this law? Of course. In other words, entering her in the contest was a conscious provocation to create a huge political scandal.\" The ban created a huge headache for Eurovision organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Eurovision's Executive Supervisor Jon Ola Sand said in March that Ukraine's decision went \"against both the spirit of the contest and the notion of inclusivity that lies at the heart of its values\". In an unprecedented move, the EBU offered Russia the chance to take part by satellite from Moscow. Russia declined: after the dramas of last year's Eurovision, Moscow was in no mood to compromise. Ukraine's 2016 winning entry, 1944, sung by Jamala, was about Joseph Stalin's deportation of Crimea's Tatar population. Russia had argued that Jamala's song broke contest rules for being of a political nature. When it won, Moscow cried foul and said there was politics at play. Now Russia seems determined to make not only Ukraine look bad, but the entire Eurovision Song Contest. When strangers are coming, they come to your house, they kill you and say 'we're not guilty' Recently, two Russian pranksters - posing as Ukraine's prime minister and his assistant - released online a telephone conversation they had recorded with a woman they claimed was EBU Director General Ingrid Deltenre. If this is the voice of the EBU's top official, it is hugely embarrassing for the EBU, because the woman on the recording makes an astonishing admission about Ukraine's winning song: \"I was just too late made aware of the song. \"If I would have been earlier, and I think it was on purpose, I would have not allowed the song to participate, to be very transparent.\" In a statement, the EBU said it would \"not comment on prank calls\". But these are high-profile Russian pranksters, who once fooled Elton John into thinking he was talking to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"Now our people don't trust Eurovision any more,\" one of the pranksters, Alexei, told me. \"People understand that any country can use their political goals to win, so it's not a fair contest anymore.\" Perhaps this is not just about a song contest? Or Russia's relations with Ukraine? Equating Eurovision with Sodom and Gomorrah and embarrassing the EBU appear part of a wider pattern of Russia trying to undermine Western institutions and Western liberal ideas. \"Russia now defines itself in its social and societal model against the West,\" believes Jan Techau of the Richard Holbrooke Forum at the American Academy in Berlin. \"The Kremlin explicitly portrays Russian society as a counter model to the corrupted West. They seem now to buy completely into the idea that whatever harms the West is good for Russia: a classic zero-sum game.\" In the run-up to this year's contest, singer Jamala warned that \"we should expect more provocations [from Russia] because our victory hurt them a lot.\" Security in Kiev is tight ahead of the first semi-final. As for Julia Samoilova, instead of singing at Eurovision this week, she will be performing - once again - in Crimea.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Alex McKechnie, then 16, was in the crowd for that first show and went on to be a regular at the club: \"I saw The Beatles a few times in the north end of Liverpool and was working in Liverpool city centre as a messenger boy in a printing works when I heard that they were on at the Cavern in a lunchtime session. \"The Cavern was in the basement of a three or four storey warehouse. The public went down one flight of stone stairs and then there were three long arches. \"At the end of one of the long arches was a little tiny stage. That's where the Beatles performed 292 times. \"I remember it being very highly charged with excitement. The music sounded even more exciting [than the previous gigs] because The Cavern was this little squashed space so the music sounded a bit louder, a bit more exciting and a bit more vital. About 20 to 30 people were there. \"The Beatles were the complete package - they didn't just have a great singer, they had two great singers. They always did harmonies right from the very first time I saw them. \"They could probably only afford two microphones, and so when one was doing the lead singing the other two were facing each other on the mic, and it was quite charismatic, it was nice to look at. They had a camaraderie about them. \"I never heard them singing one of their own songs because they were just a straight covers band at that time, as was everybody else in Liverpool. \"The standard songs that they sang - them and the other bands in Liverpool - were [by] Chuck Berry, Little Richard, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly. The sound that I very clearly remember the Beatles playing in the Cavern was a Chuck Berry riff. \"As well as doing the stock standards, the Beatles were a bit different because they were better at playing complicated chords. The Beatles were a bit more adventurous. \"It wasn't just the music and the singing, it was their lack of respect for the audience. At the Cavern for those first few gigs, they were quite irreverent to the audience and other people. They were sort of the first punk band. The Beatles were a law unto themselves on the stage. \"They were still doing that when they went to America - if someone asked them a question they didn't give a serious answer, and that's how they behaved on stage in the Cavern, and that's why I think they liked it in the Cavern. \"They were the epitome of rebellion in Liverpool because they weren't trying to imitate Cliff Richard and the Shadows doing little in time steps. They would dance out of step on purpose. \"That was their purpose in life - to upset the apple cart. They were so cheeky and so entertaining all around. They were a little bit of a voice for us against authority. I think they were rebels. We were mini rebels supporting them. \"Of course when I went back to work I used to stand gazing out of the window thinking about the Beatles and the girls at the Cavern. I couldn't really concentrate on doing any work. \"Just in a few weeks they'd gained a bigger following. When word went around, the crowd grew and people kept coming back. Once you'd seen them, not many people didn't go to see them again. \"They had big long queues, right down the length of the street and even round the corner at the bottom. But at that stage I'd dumped them. \"They started talking about going to London and making records and things like that. Betrayal. \"I wasn't the only one. I think the ones who thought that they'd discovered them were a little clique and really did give up on them when the masses found them. It was only when I heard Love Me Do on the radio that I started getting interested in them again. My wife subsequently bought all the LPs but that first era of The Beatles was over for me.\" Alex McKechnie was speaking to BBC News entertainment reporter Ian Youngs.

Announcing the rate, which was proposed by a panel of advisers, the country's deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa said: \"We are now a step closer to finalising discussions on the national minimum wage. All social partners will now decide what their take is.\" He said the panel was not endorsing the proposed figure as a living wage, but wanted to set a minimum payment for workers. Wages are politically sensitive in the country, where the official unemployment rate is close to 25%. One employment expert reckoned the figure was only about a quarter of the amount needed for the upkeep of a typical South African working-class household. Prof Chris Malikane of the University of Witwatersrand told a Johannesburg radio station: \"You would need 12,000 rand to sustain a basic household.\" The African National Congress, South Africa's ruling party, supported the proposal calling it \"credible and clearly supported by clear evidence\". However, the Economic Freedom Fighters, the country's third largest political party, said the plan \"favours business at the expense of workers\". It called for a higher minimum wage of at least 4,500 rand. South Africa faces a possible downgrade to sub-investment grade by credit ratings agencies next month, with concerns remaining over violent wage strikes. Moody's currently rates South Africa two notches above subinvestment grade, with a negative outlook, while Fitch and S&P Global Ratings have it just a step above \"junk\".

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Concern is mounting about the potential of a vicious power struggle in Addis Ababa, triggering a negative chain reaction across the region. For many of Ethiopia's Horn allies, the death has come at an awkward moment, not least because a delicate political transition in Somalia is incomplete and under serious strain, and a stand-off between South Sudan and Sudan risks dragging the region into a new armed conflagration. Mr Meles was a complex figure, hard to pigeon-hole, much less force into a one-dimensional portrait frame. A mystique has over the years grown around his personality and politics, making the task to objectively assess his legacy difficult and highly fraught. To use a Churchillian phrase, the man was a riddle and a mystery inside an enigma, and by extension so too the secretive state he presided over. But he was the one African leader who was impossible to ignore. The diminutive ex-guerilla leader was a towering figure whose austere, unsmiling and understated public persona often belied his great influence and charisma. Since 1991 he has been the undisputed and pre-eminent key player in the Horn - a formidable strategist whose role remained indispensable in the regional efforts to resolve deadly conflicts and contain militant Islamism. Domestically, his legacy is contested. To his ardent fans, he was a true revolutionary impelled by a great sense of mission to overturn the residual feudal and Stalinist structures of the ancient regime. He was the outsider whose genius led to the overthrow of an entrenched and deeply loathed dictatorship. His message of social justice and modernisation resonated with many in the homeland, especially the marginalised \"lowlanders\" in Oromia and Ogadenia. His concept of revolutionary democracy and ethnic federalism promised to create a fairer and inclusive order. Measured against these lofty and progressive ideals, his record has, at best, been patchy and rather uninspiring. The much-vaunted ambitious economic modernisation and liberalisation programme has created a new middle class, attracted huge foreign investment, spawned massive infrastructure projects, spurred economic growth and generally transformed the skylines of the major cities such as Addis Ababa and Mekele. But it has not tackled the deep structural and systemic problems and inefficiencies that have hampered real growth. The Stalinist land tenure system and the complex bureaucratic system are still intact, and the vast majority remain trapped in poverty. The democratisation and political reform process, which Mr Meles himself termed \"work in progress\", has long stalled. Since the disputed May 2005 polls, the regime has increasingly become intolerant and autocratic, using a raft of new legislation to stifle and criminalise dissent and lock up opponents. Why West will miss Meles Obituary: Meles Zenawi Life in pictures: Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi A plethora of old and new armed ethnic factions continue to wage low-level insurgencies in the periphery. The new policy of engagement and piecemeal peace pacts with a select few has so far only succeeded in managing the problem and buying the regime more time. Feeling vulnerable and insecure, Mr Meles has in the last few years become a leader whose overriding domestic political manoeuvres and calculations are driven by one instinct: regime survival. He orchestrated a discreet purge of the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the administration, demoting, sidelining or reassigning key potential rivals and opponents. His death has certainly created a leadership vacuum at the top and with no clear figure groomed to succeed him, the battle for succession could prove destabilising. That said, the prospect of a large-scale upheaval, as some fear, is highly unlikely, partly because the country has a powerful, highly disciplined and cohesive army and security apparatus. The opposition can, in theory, capitalise on the disarray within the ruling party to advance its goals and press for an early poll, but that looks difficult given the narrow factionalism and disorganisation within its ranks, not to mention the fact most of the influential opposition figures are either in exile or locked up. Mr Meles has continued to enjoy good press in the region and across much of Africa, even as his stature diminished domestically. He is hugely admired and many seem prepared to overlook his personal frailties and forgive his leadership shortcomings for one simple reason: no other African leader has in recent times deployed such great intellectual energy and firepower and used his diplomatic talent and influence to articulate the continent's key priorities and demands at global forums. He did put Africa on the map, and as a skilled and effective negotiator and spokesman he certainly forced leaders in the developed world to listen. But whether this feat alone qualifies him to join the pantheon of the continent's great visionaries, like Kwame Nkrumah and Nelson Mandela, remains debatable. Not in contention though is the fact that the late prime minister - almost single-handedly - transformed Ethiopia from a deeply conflicted and war-wracked peripheral Horn of Africa state into a supremely self-assured African diplomatic and military powerhouse. From the mid-1990s and up until 2005, Ethiopia was a key stop for high-level Western dignitaries visiting the continent, and Mr Meles the must-see African leader whose advice and counsel was sought. Many embraced him as a reformer and an elite member of the so-called \"new breed\" of African leaders. The Ethiopian leader cultivated the new friendship and used it to forge strategic partnerships to raise his country's profile and advance its geopolitical and strategic national interests. He swiftly rebuilt and modernised the army, initially in a bid to achieve parity with Sudan and negotiate a detente from a position of strength, but subsequently to \"tame\" a belligerent Eritrea, with whom relations had began to dramatically deteriorate a few years after its independence in 1991. The two countries have since fought two bloody and costly border wars beginning from 1998. A peace pact and a border arbitration treaty brokered by international mediators failed to end to conflict permanently, partly because Addis Ababa refused to fully abide by the terms of the accords and to return the tiny barren piece of land awarded to Eritrea. Hostilities have continued to simmer ever since, and periodic flare-ups are common along the volatile border. It is plausible the death of Mr Meles may - far from creating opportunities for dialogue - spur Eritrea into escalating the tension. That would be a disastrous and risky gamble which Eritrea must be dissuaded from taking. It is unlikely this is a course of action that would help it secure its perceived legitimate rights, much less win it friends in the region and beyond. In Somalia, Ethiopia's military presence in the past year has been instrumental in putting the pressure on the militant group al-Shabab. Thousands of Ethiopian troops now control a number of key strategic areas in south-central Somalia. The death of Mr Meles has raised new anxieties among the regional allies with troops in Somalia. There are growing fears a destabilising succession battle and power struggle in Addis could potentially complicate matters and jeopardise the whole mission. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said as much in a recent radio interview. Such fears are understandable, considering Ethiopia's history and political fragility. However, there is hope too the country has achieved a level of maturity and that it has the institutional mechanisms and the structural resilience to weather the current storm and ensure a smooth transition that allows for policy continuity in Somalia.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The death of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has thrown the populous Horn of Africa giant into a period of deep uncertainty and created a serious leadership vacuum in the region with profound geopolitical implications.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe death of Meles Zenawi, the Ethiopian prime minister, has raised fears of a power struggle in Addis Ababa.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 paragraph.\n\nEthiopia's Meles Zenawi dies at 57\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "The", "\u0120death", "\u0120of", "\u0120Mel", "es", "\u0120Zen", "awi", ",", "\u0120the", "\u0120Ethiopian", "\u0120prime", "\u0120minister", ",", "\u0120has", "\u0120raised", "\u0120fears", "\u0120of", "\u0120a", "\u0120power", "\u0120struggle", "\u0120in", "\u0120Add", "is", "\u0120Ab", "aba", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Sum", "mar", "ize", "\u0120the", "\u0120above", "\u0120article", "\u0120in", "\u01201", "\u0120paragraph", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Eth", "iop", "ia", "'s", "\u0120Mel", "es", "\u0120Zen", "awi", "\u0120dies", "\u0120at", "\u012057", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Sum", "mar", "ize", "\u0120the", "\u0120above", "\u0120article", "\u0120in", "\u01201", "\u0120sentence", "."], "token_logprobs": [-1.430511474609375e-05, -0.441650390625, -0.00115966796875, 0.0, -0.11505126953125, 0.0, -1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.0, -0.3623046875, -0.67626953125, -0.330810546875, -0.349853515625, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -0.005306243896484375, -0.06597900390625, -0.47900390625, -0.0186920166015625, -0.032745361328125, -0.377685546875, -0.0162200927734375, -0.0002307891845703125, -0.0206756591796875, -0.139404296875, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.03143310546875, -0.03680419921875, 0.0, -0.3642578125, -7.152557373046875e-07, 0.0, -2.5987625122070312e-05, -0.066162109375, -0.0017004013061523438, -0.0009555816650390625, -0.01464080810546875, -0.26123046875, -0.00044465065002441406, 0.0, 0.0, -0.51171875, 0.0, -0.003955841064453125, -0.0408935546875, -0.1328125, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.04010009765625, -0.10919189453125, -1.060546875, -0.007476806640625, -2.2649765014648438e-06, -0.0003027915954589844, 0.0, 0.0, -3.826618194580078e-05, -0.02484130859375, -3.0994415283203125e-06, -0.00016617774963378906, -0.0011377334594726562, -0.030029296875, -1.8715858459472656e-05], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": -2.2649765014648438e-06, "The": -0.441650390625, "\u0120death": -0.00115966796875, "\u0120of": -0.032745361328125, "\u0120Mel": -0.1328125, "es": 0.0, "\u0120Zen": 0.0, "awi": 0.0, ",": -0.005306243896484375, "\u0120the": -3.826618194580078e-05, "\u0120Ethiopian": -0.330810546875, "\u0120prime": -0.349853515625, "\u0120minister": -1.1920928955078125e-07, "\u0120has": -0.06597900390625, "\u0120raised": -0.47900390625, "\u0120fears": -0.0186920166015625, "\u0120a": -0.377685546875, "\u0120power": -0.0162200927734375, "\u0120struggle": -0.0002307891845703125, "\u0120in": -0.00016617774963378906, "\u0120Add": -0.139404296875, "is": 0.0, "\u0120Ab": 0.0, "aba": 0.0, ".": -1.8715858459472656e-05, "Sum": -0.0003027915954589844, "mar": 0.0, "ize": 0.0, "\u0120above": -0.02484130859375, "\u0120article": -3.0994415283203125e-06, "\u01201": -0.0011377334594726562, "\u0120paragraph": -0.26123046875, "Eth": -0.51171875, "iop": 0.0, "ia": -0.003955841064453125, "'s": -0.0408935546875, "\u0120dies": -0.04010009765625, "\u0120at": -0.10919189453125, "\u012057": -1.060546875, "\u0120sentence": -0.030029296875}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the Russian air force would continue its support of the Syrian armed forces. He also urged Washington to deliver on a pledge to separate moderate Syrian opposition fighters from \"terrorists\". US Secretary of State John Kerry warned the US was \"on the verge\" of suspending talks with Russia over Syria. \"It's irrational, in the context of the kind of bombing taking place, to be sitting there, trying to take things seriously,\" he told a conference in Washington. \"There is no notion or indication of seriousness of purpose with what is taking place right now.\" The Russian foreign ministry said a US refusal to co-operate would be a gift to \"terrorists\". The US and Russia have been negotiating for months to try to secure a cessation of hostilities but the latest truce collapsed last week after only a few days and attacks on eastern Aleppo have since intensified. The US warned on Wednesday it would end talks on military co-operation unless Moscow stopped the bombing. The recent cessation deal was meant to lead to joint Russian-US air strikes on so-called Islamic State and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly known as al-Nusra Front). However Russia has complained the US has not done enough to separate the more moderate rebel groups, which it backs, from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. Many of these groups have formed a strategic alliance with the more powerful Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and fight alongside it. Despite growing tensions between the two nations, Mr Peskov said Russia remains interested in pursuing talks with the US in an effort to resolve the crisis in Syria. His comments echo a statement from Moscow, which insisted it would send diplomats to Geneva to discuss ways of normalising the situation with the US. US Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday that national security agencies were reviewing all options to try to end the Syrian civil war. He said President Barack Obama had asked \"all of the agencies to put forward options, some familiar, some new, that we are very actively reviewing\". \"When we are able to work through these in the days ahead we'll have an opportunity to come back and talk about them in detail,\" he said. Meanwhile Turkey has said it will work with Russia on putting in place another ceasefire after the previous agreement collapsed. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters in Ankara \"we are more than ready\" but emphasised that nations have to try harder to find a political resolution in order for an agreement to be effective. Aleppo has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the partial truce deal disintegrated a week ago. Some 250,000 people are trapped in the east in appalling conditions, under siege from Russian-backed Syrian forces. UN aid chief Stephen O'Brien has warned that Aleppo is facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Mr O'Brien, the under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told the UN Security Council Aleppo had descended into a \"merciless abyss of humanitarian catastrophe unlike any we have witnessed in Syria\".

We think that such decisions of the acting administration, which is supposed to be in office for three more weeks, pursue two aims: finally (irrevocably?) spoiling US-Russian relations and, obviously, having an impact on the foreign policy of the future administration of the president-elect [Donald Trump].\" \"What these individuals were doing were basically collecting intelligence. They were intelligence officers operating here and using these compounds, one in New York, one in Maryland, for intelligence collection purposes. And what we are saying today is, in response to and in order to impose consequences for the Russian government's increasing harassment and aggression toward our personnel in Moscow, and, of course, their malicious cyber-activities, interfering and an effort to interfere in our election process, we are imposing consequences.\" \"They [the Russians] are trying to destabilize democracy all over the world, not just here.

We need to find out exactly what was done and what the implications of the attacks were, especially if they had an effect on our election. \"There's no doubt they were interfering and no doubt it was a cyber-attack. The question now is how much and what damage and what should the United States of America do? And so far, we've been totally paralyzed.\" \"Russia does not share America's interests. In fact, it has consistently sought to undermine them, sowing dangerous instability around the world. While today's action by the administration is overdue, it is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Instead of fees rising to \u00a39,250 per year in the autumn, Jeremy Corbyn is proposing a complete handbrake turn in saying that university tuition should not cost students anything. It's a bolder step than Labour's previous leader, who two years ago opted for a halfway house of cutting fees to \u00a36,000 - and then was accused of pleasing no-one. This is Labour going for an all-or-nothing approach - asserting free education as a fundamental principle - and creating the starkest choice in university policy for two decades. It's a direct appeal to younger voters - with surveys suggesting that students are more likely to vote Labour. It makes the pitch that no-one should be deterred from university because of the cost or fear of debt. Labour has costed the removal of fees - and the reintroduction of maintenance grants - as being worth \u00a311.2bn per year. And this is only England - because education funding is a devolved matter. There are no fees for Scottish students in Scotland and the Institute for Fiscal Studies says scrapping the lower fees charged in Northern Ireland and Wales would cost a further \u00a3500m per year. This would be covered by the \u00a348.6bn that Labour's manifesto says will be raised by tax changes - along with the party's other spending commitments. But there are lower estimates. Labour's figure is based on replacing the fees currently paid by students. But the IFS and London Economics say the cost to the Treasury could be lower, when written off loans are taken into account, with forecasts around \u00a37.5bn to \u00a38bn. Labour's big move on fees represents a complete of direction. Previously in government, Labour raised fees and in opposition proposed a modest reduction. But they are now proposing to bulldoze the apparatus of fees, loans and repayments. The most recent figures show \u00a376bn is owed in student loans in England - with this level of student debt having almost doubled in four years. From this autumn, fees will begin increasing every year with inflation and will soon glide past the \u00a310,000 mark, with interest charges also rising to 6.1%. And the Conservative government, before the election, had announced plans to sell off student debt to private investors. Under Labour's plans, this whole push towards marketisation would be ditched - and universities would return to being directly funded by government. But is there any evidence that getting rid of fees would help more young people into university, including the disadvantaged? Universities are worried that such a switch to direct funding, dependent on government finances, would put a limit on places and a brake on expansion. One of the quiet revolutions of recent years has been the complete removal of limits on student numbers - with universities able to recruit as many students as they can accommodate - and opening the door to rising numbers of graduates. The argument for fees has always been that they provide the funding to allow more young people to go to university - and that a much smaller proportion went to university when there were no fees. This year has seen a fall of 5% in university applications from UK students - and it follows a pattern of dips when fees are increased. But the long-term trend has been relentlessly upwards, with a huge growth in demand for university places. It remains a powerful symbol of family aspiration. Although wealthy families remain much more likely to send their children to university - entry rates have risen across all social classes, including the poorest. Do students get value for money from tuition fees? Is this an investment that is repaid in better job prospects? Department for Education figures published last month showed that graduates remained more likely to be in a job than non-graduates and on average earned \u00a310,000 per year more. Among younger people, this graduate advantage is less, at \u00a36,000 per year. But the figures also showed that, despite rises in fees, graduate salaries have stagnated over the past decade. Labour's plan sends a strong political signal to young voters. A survey from the Higher Education Policy Institute, taken before the manifesto publication, suggested that Labour is now more popular among students than it was in any of the three previous general elections. The survey found Labour significantly ahead in the student vote. The Liberal Democrats, once the most popular party for students, are trailing in third behind the Conservatives. Is this still the cloud of tuition fees hanging over the Lib Dems from their U-turn during the coalition government? Could they really entirely scrap fees? There will be plenty of scrutiny over funding Labour's plans. But there is nothing unprecedented or outlandish about getting rid of fees. Germany has phased out tuition fees - and universities in the Netherlands and Scandinavia try to recruit students from England with the offer of low or no fees. French undergraduates can study for low fees. In the United States, New York state is introducing free fees for students from families earning up to about \u00a3100,000 per year, offering a handout to the squeezed middle classes.

An initial AAIB report said Mr Hill was thrown clear of the aircraft during the later part of the crash, but it is not clear whether he initiated his ejection. After the crash, the pilot's family issued a statement which said they were devastated and deeply saddened by the loss of life and sent prayers and heartfelt condolences to the families of all those affected.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Dan Coats also told a Senate panel he did not think it was \"appropriate\" to discuss his conversations with the president at a public hearing. His comments follow a report that President Donald Trump asked him to derail the Russia investigation. The National Security Agency chief also declined to comment on the matter. Admiral Mike Rogers told a Senate intelligence committee on Wednesday he has never \"been directed to do anything illegal, immoral, unethical or inappropriate\" as NSA director. Mr Coats echoed Mr Rogers' statements as senators pressed the pair on their interactions with the president. \"I'm willing to come before the committee and tell you what I know and don't know,\" he said. \"What I'm not willing to do is share information I think ought to be protected in an opening hearing,\" Mr Coats told the panel. He is later appearing in a closed session before the committee on Wednesday afternoon. This Senate testimony by intelligence community heads was billed as the undercard to James Comey's appearance on Capitol Hill on Thursday, but it turned out to be a big letdown. Top intelligence officials in the US government have taken a bunker mentality when it comes to the investigation into Russian meddling in the US election, refusing to share details of presidential conversations in open Senate testimony. Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation, it seems, has the spooks spooked. That may come as a relief to a White House that has been buffeted by a seemingly never-ending stream of controversial revelations, from allegations that the president attempted to influence the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn to reports of internal divisions within the administration. The president and his aides shouldn't breath easy, however. Although today's testimony was largely a dud, Mr Comey - no longer a government employee, thanks to Mr Trump - will have more leeway to discuss his interactions with the president if he so chooses. His former colleagues my have seen discretion as the better part of valour, but the former director isn't known for backing down from a fight. Mr Coats testimony comes a day after the Washington Post reported that he told associates Mr Trump had tried to persuade the FBI to back off their investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and his ties to the Kremlin. US intelligence agencies believe Russia interfered in the US election and they are investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But there is no known evidence of collusion and President Donald Trump has dismissed the story as \"fake news\". The two intelligence chiefs joined acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to testify before the panel on Wednesday. The lack of answers appeared to frustrate both Democratic and Republican senators, who repeatedly pressed the intelligence officials on the Russia inquiry. Republican Senator Richard Burr, who chairs the committee, ended the hearing by appearing to rebuke the intelligence officials for their testimony. \"At no time should you be in a position where you come to Congress without an answer,\" he said. The following day will see the much-anticipated testimony of Mr Comey, who was leading one of the Russia investigations before Mr Trump fired him. He will be quizzed on his interactions with the president before he was sacked. Mr Comey reportedly told Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he did not want to be left alone with the president. The conversation occurred the day after the president asked Mr Comey to end the investigation into Mr Flynn during a private dinner, according to the New York Times.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: As part of our fight against this, we have a very much underutilised tool - food. In BBC One's Doctor in the House, I try to help 34-year-old Emma Gleeson, who has been experiencing anxiety, depression and panic attacks for many years. She was 19 when she really began struggling with mental health. Following a severe episode of pneumonia, she ended up in intensive care in a coma. When she woke up she was petrified. She developed an extreme fear of death, and this can precipitate her panic attacks. During an attack, Emma feels terrified, and can often scream out loud. It is extremely worrying for her family and can be scary to onlookers. Emma has tried various medications and counselling therapies but was still struggling and getting three to four panic attacks per day. One of the ways in which I helped her was by changing her food choices. Despite being sceptical at first, I was able to show Emma the hidden power of food in helping her mental state. \"I had been living on a diet of takeaways, fizzy drinks and general processed and convenience foods for as long as I can remember, and didn't for one moment think that what I ate was contributing in any way to the anxiety and panic attacks I'd been experiencing for years,\" she said. \"Since meeting and spending time with Dr Rangan, he has changed my entire outlook on food, and why certain foods were potentially having a negative impact on my mental health. \"I now only buy and cook with fresh food, I make my own stocks, I eat plenty of fish and I try to reduce the amount of sugar I consume. \"I feel so much better and intend to keep this up.\" The evidence of food's link to mental states has been growing. A landmark 2015 article in the prestigious Lancet journal stated that nutrition may be as important to mental health as it is to cardiology, endocrinology and gastroenterology. Plus, a small but important interventional Australian study from earlier this year showed that a modified Mediterranean diet significantly helped many patients with severe depression within 12 weeks. Unfortunately, this has not translated into routine patient care and most doctors still do not discuss food with their mental health patients. This has to change. Many of us do not think about how food can impact the way we feel, but we all know the feeling of using food as a quick pick-me-up. When we are feeling a little tired, a little stressed or a little low, we often reach for a sugary snack to help us feel good in the short term. But, this can actually make things worse in the long term. The food you are eating is literally \"shocking\" your body. By changing her diet, as well as reducing her alcohol intake, Emma experienced a reduction in anxiety, an improvement in mood and fewer panic attacks. She also described feeling mentally stronger, having a clearer head, more energy and a greater ability to cope with stress. It has also encouraged her to be more active and do more things at weekends, which also helps her mental health. Of course, there can be many other factors to consider with mental health problems and it is always worth getting advice from a qualified healthcare professional. There can be many other important factors to consider with mental health problems, such as emotional trauma and stress, but we should not underestimate the power of changing our food to improve our mood. As a doctor, I like to empower my patients. Here are four of the tips that helped Emma, that can also help you: 1. Reduce sugar and processed foods Sugar, food that contains sugar, or even food that is converted quickly into sugar, such as many breakfast cereals, cause your blood sugar to rapidly rise. Within two to three hours your sugar levels then start to fall. At this point, you may not only feel hungry, you can feel \"h-angry\" as well - hungry and angry. Low and falling blood sugar levels can cause a rise in your body's stress hormones, cortisol and adrenaline. This can have a negative impact on your mood. 2. Increase your intake of Omega-3 fats This is an essential nutrient for brain function and may protect against anxiety and other psychiatric disorders. Foods high in Omega-3 fats include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, anchovies), grass-fed meat, seeds and leafy vegetables. 3. Eat more tryptophan-containing foods like pork, chicken, seeds and walnuts Tryptophan is an amino acid the body converts into serotonin, your feel-good neurotransmitter. Eat them with a healthy carbohydrate source such as sweet potatoes, which helps to transport more tryptophan into your blood. 4. Feed your gut bugs Some scientists refer to the trillions of gut bugs that live inside us, the gut microbiota, as the brain's peacekeepers. It is thought that having a healthy population of gut bugs can have a significant influence on your mood via the gut-brain axis. The prebiotic fibre contained in vegetables help your gut bugs to proliferate, so the best way to maintain a healthy population is to increase your intake of vegetables, as well as fermented foods such as sauerkraut.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Washington blamed Russia and the Syrian government for intensifying their attacks against civilians. Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: \"The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. \"Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. \"Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,\" Mr Kirby said, admitting that \"this is not a decision that was taken lightly\". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been \"targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy\". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said: \"We regret this decision by Washington.\" \"Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. \"After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,\" Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: The news has prompted headlines around the world, and Politicians and city leaders have taken to Twitter to congratulate him, including the left-leaning mayors of New York and Paris. Congratulations also came from Ahok Basuki Purnama, the governor of Jakarta. He became Jakarta's first Christian governor in 50 years when he was elected in 2014. Jemima Goldsmith, the sister of Conservative party rival Zac Goldsmith, congratulated Mr Khan on his victory. The ex-wife of Pakistani cricketer and politician Imran Khan also appeared to criticise her brother's campaign. The New York Times describes Mr Khan's victory as \"striking\" and leads with the fact that he is London's first Muslim mayor. It described London as a city with an acute shortage of affordable homes and a creaking, overcrowded mass transit network. A commentary in German news magazine Der Spiegel describes Mr Khan's win as a \"victory over Islamophobia\", and says London is breaking new ground. \"The mayoral election shows that London is more liberal, clever and tolerant than the Conservative mudslingers would like to think,\" it says. Qatari daily Al-Sharq says: \"Once again, the British capital enters history, this time through the gate of democratic victory by electing a Muslim of immigrant descent as its mayor.\" Pakistan's Dawn newspaper says that Khan should see himself as a role model for millions of Muslims living in Europe. With the rise of increasingly popular right-wing parties across the continent, the paper's Brussels correspondent Shada Islam writes that \"Khan's story should help set the record straight on immigration, integration and European Muslims\". History Professor Juan Cole points out that Mr Khan is by no means the first Muslim in charge of a European city. In a popular blog post he traces the history of Muslim rule in Spain, Greece, the Balkans, and Sicily. \"Not to mention that Constantinople/Istanbul is one of the larger European cities... the mayor there is a Muslim,\" he says. Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, former co-chair of the UK Conservative Party, and Business Secretary Sajid Javid congratulated Mr Khan and pointed out their similar backgrounds. \"Bus drivers are clearly the new Etonians\" quipped writer and conservative activist Tim Montgomerie, referring to the elite public school attended by Prime Minister David Cameron and Mr Goldsmith. In France's Le Figaro, London-based French essayist Laetitia Strauch-Bonnart says \"two images of the United Kingdom\" faced each other in this election: The \"exemplary success story\" of Mr Khan's life and \"the billionaire's son\", Mr Goldsmith. \"In order to appeal nowadays, it is better to have a disadvantaged background, a personal history made of difficulties and social mobility,\" she told the paper. \"It's the spirit of the time, and Goldsmith was not on the right side.\" Finally, before the result was in, former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt tweeted a warning about how Mr Khan could possibly be treated if Republican hopeful Donald Trump was to become US President.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Labour's Sadiq Khan has been elected Mayor of London, becoming the city's first Muslim mayor.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe British election has been called a victory for liberal values, with the first Muslim mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, winning a landslide victory.\n\nSummarize the article.\n\nSadiq Khan is the first Muslim mayor of London and the first Muslim to win a seat in the British parliament.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: The archive of travel writer, war hero and adventurer Sir Patrick Leigh Fermor has been catalogued by the National Library of Scotland. The collection includes letters from Prince Charles and Truman Capote. Sir Patrick, who was known as Paddy, died in 2011 at the age of 96. He published several books on his travels around the world and one of the most prized items in the archive is the only surviving notebook from his 1933 trek across Europe. The trek provided the material for his most famous books, 'A Time of Gifts', 'Between the Woods and the Water' and 'The Broken Road'. Thousands of items which occupy 16 metres of shelving took a year to be catalogued by library staff. Along with letters from notable 20th century figures they also uncovered literary manuscripts, sketches and what appears to be an unpublished John Betjeman poem on the back of an envelope. Sir Patrick spent much of World War Two on Nazi-occupied Crete. During his time there he disguised himself as a shepherd to organise guerrilla operations against the Nazis. He led one of the most daring feats of the war in 1944, capturing the commander of the German garrison on Crete. The 1957 film starring Dirk Bogarde 'Ill Met by Moonlight' was based on the operation. Graham Stewart, the library curator who worked on the archive project, said: \"It is a history of the colourful life of a celebrated writer.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: \"There's a lot going on right now,\"  the singer tells us. And she's not wrong. The follow-up to her Mercury Prize-nominated debut, 2013's Sing To The Moon, is imminent. Second album The Dreaming Room is due in June and her newest track Phenomenal Woman has just debuted as Annie Mac's hottest record on BBC Radio 1. \"And then we have probably the most important live moment on TV in this country today,\" she adds. \"It's all potentially extremely exciting - and that just means that I'm naturally terrified.\" The singer's struggles with stage fright and anxiety are well-documented and live TV is a particular fear. Describing the concept as \"just hellish\", she tells us: \"I'd rather die. That's how I feel sometimes - I think, 'if I dropped dead I wouldn't have to do it!'.\" So, it's perhaps surprising that the singer let us tag along as she kicked off the new series of Later... with Jools Holland. But it seems BBC Two's esteemed music show has a special place in her heart. \"In the musician's world, you say 'Jools Holland' and all of a sudden you've got massive respect - it's like saying you got Glastonbury.\" Her third time on Later... she calls respected musician and presenter Holland a \"genuine champion\". \"He called me this afternoon just to say that he'd been listening to my new record and he wanted to tell me specifically what song and what parts and why. \"I tell you, in the TV world, it's not the kind of place where there's room for those kind of genuine interactions, just because there's so much pressure on everyone. It's very special.\" Here the diary of Laura's day. Tour manager Paul picks us up in sunny east London. Laura's assistant Mariama is laden with popcorn and snacks as we pile into the silver Mercedes van bound for the studios in Kent. The singer takes some me-time behind her shades, safe in the knowledge it's going to be a long day. \"I'm such a weird person to be around before anything big,\" she admits. \"I can't normally talk, so my team tend to just leave me to it, but I'll pick up. \"Right now I want to be jumping up, but you don't want to celebrate before the main event, so I'm just trying to be as relaxed as I can.\" We arrive to the sounds of Kano and his brass section sound-checking. He's on the bill along with Paul Simon, The Coral, Jason Isbell and Lake Street Dive. Laura has the honour of opening and closing both the live and pre-recorded shows, something she says she's \"glad you only find out on the day\". \"I'm doing Phenomenal Woman, Kiss My Feet - which the Jools team requested - and Overcome, the first single, which featured Nile Rogers. \"I wanted to explode back onto the scene with something that was captivating in a much rawer and darker way. That's why there's dance and so much movement this time around, and why it's such a visual album.\" Backstage the band are split across two dressing rooms - one for the boys and one for the girls, where we're quickly made welcome as they debate which of the many black items of clothing they've brought will get worn. \"There's nine of us - it's huge by pop terms, but I refused to compromise,\" says Laura. \"With Sing To The Moon, six of us were trying to sound like an orchestra and a choir. It was a stress. \"My sister Dionne went from violin to guitar - literally learnt the guitar [and] is killing it - my brother's playing cello. It feels much more like a band than me trying to do the solo artist thing. We feel like a really solid family.\" Still in her fur-lined boots and denim dress from the journey, Laura and the band head to the camera rehearsal. Jools arrives and gives Laura a hug, waving hello to the production team. Giant white cue cards are being written to help him introduce the acts. Running through each of their tracks twice, Laura sports her new keytar in place of her trademark piano. \"Lady Mariama was up until 4am trying to make my keytar white. I mean what the hell is that about?\" she laughs. \"Initially it was a joke idea, I was just messing about jamming with it, but it made so much sense. I'm not stuck behind anything in a static way anymore, I can move and I can see people. If I want to turn and feel the band I can do that. We have such a good time now.\" Time for some nourishment. The team (\"there's like millions of them... making it work\") are handed pocket money for the canteen, while Laura retreats to her dressing room. As well as make-up, wardrobe and calming those nerves, she also has a TV interview to fit in. \"I used to not eat, I couldn't eat. But I've learned to, so you don't drop off after one song. I have meatballs and sweet potato fries. And a balance of water and red wine.\" \"[Designer] Alex Noble has done a lot of my clothes recently,\" says Laura. \"He is just on another planet. He text me yesterday and I was just weeping emojis because the clothes are just... I mean you'll see with the outfit tonight. \"I made a visual essay for the album, this massive book [filled with] images, as stimulus for new music but also to help anybody I might be collaborating with. Stylists or people in the label, anyone could take the book and go 'oh yeah, I'm listening and I'm looking'. \"It means I get to talk less. That's probably surprising to some people because I do love to natter! But it helps.\" Minutes before show time, Laura's designer and assistant are still huddled together in one of the dressing rooms with a needle and thread and the singer's fabulous outfit in their hands. She's set to do an interview at Jools's famous piano, but the purple corset she'll be wearing (with matching super-flared trousers) will be too tight to sit down in. Cue furious unpicking and re-stitching. Eventually it's decided she'll do the interview standing up. Problem solved. With the audience in place and schooled on how to cheer and clap in the correct manner, Laura's up first - opening the pre-recorded show with Maya Angelou-inspired anthem Phenomenal Woman. \"If you're first out of the blocks - you're the thing in the room that makes the first sound. I've been second and third before and everybody breathes when the sound's been made,\" says Laura. There's mild panic when the lighting desk freezes after The Coral perform, but after a few minutes of confusion they're rolling again. Later, a respectful hush descends as Paul Simon performs Sounds Of Silence in the centre of the studio. \"He made me cry so much,\" says Laura. \"I kept thinking, 'why didn't I bring Mum to this gig?'. She was raised on Simon and Garfunkel. \"I ended up thinking about my whole life, my creative life... what is this all about? Here I am literally stood in front of Mr Paul Simon.\" With all the stars limbered up (and the shortest of toilet breaks), the second show goes live on BBC Two. \"It's an amazing feeling because you know that it's happening now and everybody's tuned in, but at the same time - the fear and the dread. You can't correct anything, so whatever comes out is it. \" Laura ends the live show on a high with Phenomenal Woman. \"That for me was surprisingly wonderful, because live television literally - there's nothing that I'm more terrified of! And the live performance was better than the pre-record - what?!\" It's all over. The audience files out and the set's dismantled as artists and their teams pack up their gear and rush to congratulate each other. US outfit Lake Street Dive collar Laura for a picture, while she and sister Dionne seek out Kano for a snap (\"Because he's fine. And obviously amazing\"). \"I always forget how emotionally exhausting it is,\" says Laura. \"The amount I invest into any performance is always bucket loads of sweat or tension that doesn't get released until I'm in that moment. \"That's the uniqueness of a show like Jools's - you are getting that concentrated performance.\" So what now? \"Everybody laughs at me because I literally make a beeline for my bed after. I'll probably eat again later because I always get a major appetite, which is why I have this thing [grabs belly area] that will never go away. \"But yeah, I just conk out.

He made his return to the Newcastle first team for the 1-0 defeat by Manchester United on 4 March as a substitute. Gutierrez, who joined the Magpies from Real Mallorca in July 2008, is out of contract in the summer but is just focused on playing regularly again for the time being. \"I know my situation here is a little tricky,\" he said. \"The one thing I can do is work hard and do my best. \"I want to stay in England and I love the Premier League, but I don't know about the future. \"At present, I am with Newcastle and have two months to finish the season. When the season finishes, I start thinking about the future.\" The full interview with Jonas Gutierrez can be seen on Saturday's Football Focus at 1130 (GMT) and below are some of the highlights. \"When they told me I had cancer, it was a shock. I remember I was with the Newcastle doctor and I started crying,\" said Gutierrez. \"I went to my house to speak to my dad and he thought I was making a joke with him. He didn't realise and believe what I was telling him.\" He added: \"Chemotherapy is a hard treatment. I was just thinking after each session it was a day less I had to recover. \"I received a lot of support. To be back and train, do what you love, is another thing that makes you recover quickly.\" \"It was really emotional to be back. It was good to have a first step a few days before against Aston Villa and be on the bench,\" said Gutierrez. \"When I came on against United, I could just focus on the game. It was unbelievable and to get the armband was a great touch. \"Now I want to fight for my place. What is in my head is to work hard, do all I can to get minutes on the pitch.\" \"When the doctor told me I was recovering, I wanted to make a new tattoo,\" Gutierrez added. \"I love Eminem, so I put part of a song on my arm and I put the date.

The deal in January 2015 for \u00a31.75m, was a record sale for the club. The profits came in the same year that the club were forced to get an emergency loan to pay players' wages. In June 2014 cashflow problems meant the Professional Footballers' Association stepped in to pay the players and forced Exeter into a transfer embargo which was only lifted in August of that year. The club's accounts also show that Exeter had a surplus of shareholders' funds of \u00a3761,000, compared to a deficit of \u00a3880,000 the previous year and reduced their cost base by almost 5%. Exeter are hoping to redevelop St James Park after being given planning permission last month. \"The board have agreed in broad terms how the income from the transfer should be spent to improve the infrastructure strength of the club in line with its vision and underlying model and these plans are now being developed in detail for further presentation,\" said a club statement.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "League Two Exeter City made a profit of over \u00a31.6m last year, according to the club's latest accounts.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nExeter City FC have been given a \u00a31.5 million loan by the Exeter City Supporters Trust.\n\nWhat is the most important information you think we should know about this story?\n\nThis loan will help Exeter City FC to continue their work in the community.\n\nPlease tell us wh", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "Ex", "eter", "\u0120City", "\u0120FC", "\u0120have", "\u0120been", "\u0120given", "\u0120a", "\u0120\u00c2\u00a3", "1", ".", "5", "\u0120million", "\u0120loan", "\u0120by", "\u0120the", "\u0120Ex", "eter", "\u0120City", "\u0120Supporters", "\u0120Trust", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "What", "\u0120is", "\u0120the", "\u0120most", "\u0120important", "\u0120information", "\u0120you", "\u0120think", "\u0120we", "\u0120should", "\u0120know", "\u0120about", "\u0120this", "\u0120story", "?", "\u010a", "\u010a", "This", "\u0120loan", "\u0120will", "\u0120help", "\u0120Ex", "eter", "\u0120City", "\u0120FC", "\u0120to", "\u0120continue", "\u0120their", "\u0120work", "\u0120in", "\u0120the", "\u0120community", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Please", "\u0120tell", "\u0120us", "\u0120why"], "token_logprobs": [-3.0279159545898438e-05, -0.2169189453125, -6.651878356933594e-05, -1.8477439880371094e-05, -0.96435546875, -0.5029296875, -0.8857421875, -0.09991455078125, -0.479736328125, -0.02313232421875, -0.08154296875, -0.007843017578125, -0.326416015625, -0.4873046875, -0.244873046875, -0.59814453125, -0.0038051605224609375, -0.053619384765625, -4.0531158447265625e-06, -2.1457672119140625e-06, -0.07427978515625, -0.006427764892578125, -0.25341796875, -0.361328125, 0.0, -0.2474365234375, -0.035919189453125, -0.0033435821533203125, -1.0107421875, -0.6923828125, -0.73974609375, -0.0989990234375, -0.2191162109375, -0.1785888671875, -6.61611557006836e-05, -0.30517578125, -0.1002197265625, -0.05792236328125, -0.45361328125, -3.5762786865234375e-07, -0.0008840560913085938, -2.384185791015625e-07, -0.3837890625, -0.431884765625, -0.340576171875, -0.544921875, -0.01476287841796875, 0.0, -2.384185791015625e-07, -0.0089874267578125, -0.10888671875, -0.9326171875, -0.0189971923828125, -0.71630859375, -0.29638671875, -0.009307861328125, -0.0009174346923828125, -0.06134033203125, -0.000946044921875, 0.0, -0.083984375, -0.46240234375, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -0.003391265869140625], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": 0.0, "Ex": -0.2169189453125, "eter": 0.0, "\u0120City": -2.384185791015625e-07, "\u0120FC": -0.0089874267578125, "\u0120have": -0.5029296875, "\u0120been": -0.8857421875, "\u0120given": -0.09991455078125, "\u0120a": -0.479736328125, "\u0120\u00c2\u00a3": -0.02313232421875, "1": -0.08154296875, ".": -0.06134033203125, "5": -0.326416015625, "\u0120million": -0.4873046875, "\u0120loan": -0.431884765625, "\u0120by": -0.59814453125, "\u0120the": -0.009307861328125, "\u0120Ex": -0.01476287841796875, "\u0120Supporters": -0.07427978515625, "\u0120Trust": -0.006427764892578125, "What": -0.2474365234375, "\u0120is": -0.035919189453125, "\u0120most": -1.0107421875, "\u0120important": -0.6923828125, "\u0120information": -0.73974609375, "\u0120you": -0.0989990234375, "\u0120think": -0.2191162109375, "\u0120we": -0.1785888671875, "\u0120should": -6.61611557006836e-05, "\u0120know": -0.30517578125, "\u0120about": -0.1002197265625, "\u0120this": -0.05792236328125, "\u0120story": -0.45361328125, "?": -3.5762786865234375e-07, "This": -0.3837890625, "\u0120will": -0.340576171875, "\u0120help": -0.544921875, "\u0120to": -0.10888671875, "\u0120continue": -0.9326171875, "\u0120their": -0.0189971923828125, "\u0120work": -0.71630859375, "\u0120in": -0.29638671875, "\u0120community": -0.0009174346923828125, "Please": -0.083984375, "\u0120tell": -0.46240234375, "\u0120us": -1.1920928955078125e-07, "\u0120why": -0.003391265869140625}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

He had a lot of dreams within the para-sports movement, \" Rashed said, adding that the UAE team will still compete in London. \"The athletes were very close to Abdullah, they trained in the same centre in the UAE. It's really very difficult for all of us but we promised ourselves that we are going to continue and we are going to win something for Abdullah, bringing the best performance from the athletes. \"We are working with the athletes to get them in a better situation, obviously today will be better than yesterday, tomorrow we believe will be even better for them.\" The Metropolitan Police said emergency services \"were called shortly after 17:00hrs on Tuesday... to reports of a seriously injured man at Newham Leisure Centre\".

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: The end of last year saw growth across several sectors of the economy, but there are concerns about rising prices, skill shortages and falling sales. Manufacturers reported their highest growth in new orders for nearly three years, with export demand still strong. In retail, there was also a return to optimism - though only just, and despite profitability being squeezed. In tourism, firms reported improving visitor numbers in the final quarter of the year, but falling sales revenues. Responses to the survey, carried out for the Chambers of Commerce by Strathclyde University economists at the Fraser of Allander Institute, were more positive than the economic figures published on Wednesday. The Labour Force Survey and the Gross Domestic Product figures showed weakness in the Scottish economy, while covering an earlier part of 2016 than the Chambers' survey. While the GDP assessment from the Scottish government has seen a sharp contraction in the past year, the Chambers found a more positive picture, with growth in private commercial contracts. However, there are warning signals survey, with tourism companies having difficulties in finding skilled recruits. Retail firms flagged up rising prices. Construction is expecting an investment dip. The weakest of the five sectors covered was finance and business services. More firms in that large part of the economy saw employment fall than saw it rise. But on balance, firms say sales revenue is expected to increase. Neil Amner, chairman of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce economic advisory group, said: \"Our latest economic data shows that many Scottish businesses will have a successful 2017, with business optimism remaining positive for many sectors. \"This is good news for the economy, particularly as we continue to deal with international uncertainty and domestic issues including a rating revaluation and a potential divergence of Income Tax between Scotland and the rest of the UK. \"The overall business mood remains positive but firms expect business growth to be challenged by rising prices, tightening of cash flow and profitability, higher import costs impacted by exchange rates and a likely increase of inflation as the year goes on. \"On the converse side, exporters are continuing to report a healthy growth in trade, though perhaps not quite matching up to their initial expectations. \"Optimism could hardly be more finely balanced and anything that rocks the boat could change the glass from half full to half empty. \"Business success in 2017 will largely depend upon the ability of firms to manage costs and for consumer demand to remain strong in the face of pressures to real incomes.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Manufacturers have reported positive business trends, in the latest survey from the Scottish Chambers of Commerce.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Scottish Chambers of Commerce is forecasting a mixed year for the Scottish economy in 2017.\n\nWhat is the main idea of the article?\n\nThe Scottish Chambers of Commerce is forecasting a mixed year for the Scottish economy in 2017.\n\nSummarize the main points of the article.\n\nThe Chamber", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "The", "\u0120Scottish", "\u0120Chambers", "\u0120of", "\u0120Commerce", "\u0120is", "\u0120forecasting", "\u0120a", "\u0120mixed", "\u0120year", "\u0120for", "\u0120the", "\u0120Scottish", "\u0120economy", "\u0120in", "\u01202017", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "What", "\u0120is", "\u0120the", "\u0120main", "\u0120idea", "\u0120of", "\u0120the", "\u0120article", "?", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "\u0120Scottish", "\u0120Chambers", "\u0120of", "\u0120Commerce", "\u0120is", "\u0120forecasting", "\u0120a", "\u0120mixed", "\u0120year", "\u0120for", "\u0120the", "\u0120Scottish", "\u0120economy", "\u0120in", "\u01202017", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Sum", "mar", "ize", "\u0120the", "\u0120main", "\u0120points", "\u0120of", "\u0120the", "\u0120article", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "\u0120Chambers"], "token_logprobs": [-0.00019037723541259766, -0.044647216796875, -0.1036376953125, -1.6689300537109375e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -0.81787109375, -1.2939453125, -0.03741455078125, -0.305908203125, -0.356689453125, -0.009857177734375, -0.4638671875, -0.051666259765625, -4.291534423828125e-06, -0.1295166015625, -5.960464477539062e-07, -0.056732177734375, -0.2783203125, 0.0, -0.26220703125, -0.03607177734375, -0.0033111572265625, -0.5224609375, -0.015106201171875, -0.0252532958984375, -0.09161376953125, -0.0004930496215820312, -2.1457672119140625e-06, -1.3113021850585938e-06, -2.5987625122070312e-05, -0.00444793701171875, -0.407470703125, -3.445148468017578e-05, -1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.0, -0.050750732421875, -0.0022563934326171875, -0.0002199411392211914, 0.0, -0.048370361328125, -0.0001417398452758789, -0.0009737014770507812, -0.0005359649658203125, -3.5762786865234375e-07, -0.006656646728515625, 0.0, -0.006740570068359375, -0.0159454345703125, 0.0, -0.03729248046875, -3.1113624572753906e-05, -2.5033950805664062e-06, -9.298324584960938e-06, -0.06744384765625, -0.039031982421875, -0.00772857666015625, -4.398822784423828e-05, -0.00021016597747802734, -0.296875, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00026154518127441406, -0.031646728515625], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": 0.0, "The": -0.00026154518127441406, "\u0120Scottish": -0.0005359649658203125, "\u0120Chambers": -0.031646728515625, "\u0120of": -0.00772857666015625, "\u0120Commerce": 0.0, "\u0120is": -0.050750732421875, "\u0120forecasting": -0.0022563934326171875, "\u0120a": -0.0002199411392211914, "\u0120mixed": 0.0, "\u0120year": -0.048370361328125, "\u0120for": -0.0001417398452758789, "\u0120the": -4.398822784423828e-05, "\u0120economy": -3.5762786865234375e-07, "\u0120in": -0.006656646728515625, "\u01202017": 0.0, ".": -0.296875, "What": -0.26220703125, "\u0120main": -0.06744384765625, "\u0120idea": -0.015106201171875, "\u0120article": -0.00021016597747802734, "?": -2.1457672119140625e-06, "Sum": -0.03729248046875, "mar": -3.1113624572753906e-05, "ize": -2.5033950805664062e-06, "\u0120points": -0.039031982421875}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}
{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: The proceedings in London will be \"the first time that undercover policing has been exposed to the rigour of public examination,\" he told a court. Helen Steel, who had a relationship with an undercover officer, said police committed \"human rights abuses\". But police said undercover officers can play an important role. Lawyers investigating allegations for the Home Office say they have uncovered more than 80 possible miscarriages of justice relating to undercover policing. Investigations revealed officers had also had relationships with women while undercover, and had used the names of dead children. Undercover: The allegations made to date Opening proceedings at the Royal Courts of Justice, Lord Justice Pitchford said: \"It seems likely that the inquiry will expose both creditable and discreditable conduct, practice and management. \"At the conclusion of its investigation, the inquiry will report to the home secretary and make recommendations as to the deployment of undercover police officers in future.\" \"Jacqui\", who had a son with a man she thought was a fellow animal rights activist, did not discover he was an undercover police officer until 25 years after he disappeared from her life. She told the BBC the discovery was \"like an earthquake\". \"I want this inquiry to really get to the truth... and come to some conclusion about whether this money and human misery was worth it\". She wants the officers themselves to have the chance to give evidence, perhaps anonymously, \"and not have to worry about the Official Secrets Act or what's going to happen to them\". She hopes \"what happened to me... what happened to other women, will never happen again. \"There is no circumstance where having sexual relations in order to get information on a group, whatever the group is, is ever justified.\" The home secretary ordered the review after claims police spied on the family of Stephen Lawrence. Neville Lawrence, Stephen's father, said more than one judge should oversee the case, or its conclusions should be left to a jury. \"You have an old saying - two heads are better than one,\" he said. \"Sometimes one person might miss something and the other one can bring them back to where they're supposed to be\". And Ms Steel said: \"These undercover policing units have committed grievous human rights abuses which are absolutely shocking in a supposedly democratic society. We want to make sure they don't happen again to anybody else, and for that to happen we need the full truth to emerge.\" Case study \"Alison\" was a member of an independent political group in London in the 1990s when she formed a relationship with a man she knew as Mark Cassidy. They were together for five years and lived together for four. But Mark disappeared suddenly, saying he'd had a row with his mother and was depressed. \"His disappearance five years after we met was very sudden and unexpected and didn't make sense. I spent a long time trying to find out where he was and why he'd left,\" Alison told Radio 4's Today programme. She believes claims of depression were part of an \"exit strategy\" used by officers. \"I knew I had to get on with my life and I did that, but still carried on looking and searching when I could,\" she added. She later found out \"Mark\" had a wife and children. \"I've carried on with my life, I've met somebody else who I grew up with as a child which was the only reason I was able to trust them was because I knew that they were who they said they were. \"And I've been fortunate enough to have a family, but many of the women who this has happened to have not been so fortunate.\" Lord Justice Pitchford's inquiry at the Royal Courts of Justice will look into police infiltration of political and social justice groups in England and Wales since 1968. The inquiry is expected to be split into three parts: establishing what happened, examining the procedures adopted by police to prevent wrongdoing, and recommendations for the future. Preliminary hearings are due to start in the autumn and the inquiry is set to last three years. The inquiry's terms of reference include: The allegations were first widely reported in 2011 when a former undercover officer, Mark Kennedy, offered to help defend, in court, six environmental campaigners whom he had infiltrated. That trial collapsed - and later the same year, there were further revelations of undercover relationships, one of which led to a child. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The allegations of wrongdoing by undercover police officers that have emerged since 2011 have been extraordinary. That steady stream of stories has led to the launch of a major public inquiry into their activities. The breadth and nature of what is being alleged is almost too big to grasp, but it fundamentally comes down to a simple question of whether elements of the police were out of control. Seven key issues the inquiry will examine. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said undercover policing was an important tactic, but had to be done legally. He told BBC London: \"We, for the police, will make the case that our undercover officers are incredibly brave and they deal with some very dangerous people. \"We think this is a vital part of our toolset and if we don't have it then we don't suffer, but the public might.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The public inquiry into undercover policing may \"expose both creditable and discreditable conduct\", chairman Lord Justice Pitchford has warned.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe inquiry will examine the use of undercover officers in the past.\n\nThe inquiry will examine the use of undercover officers in the past.\n\nThe inquiry will examine the use of undercover officers in the past.\n\nThe inquiry will examine the use of undercover officers in the past.\n\nThe inquiry wil", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "The", "\u0120inquiry", "\u0120will", "\u0120examine", "\u0120the", "\u0120use", "\u0120of", "\u0120undercover", "\u0120officers", "\u0120in", "\u0120the", "\u0120past", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "\u0120inquiry", "\u0120will", "\u0120examine", "\u0120the", "\u0120use", "\u0120of", "\u0120undercover", "\u0120officers", "\u0120in", "\u0120the", "\u0120past", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "\u0120inquiry", "\u0120will", "\u0120examine", "\u0120the", "\u0120use", "\u0120of", "\u0120undercover", "\u0120officers", "\u0120in", "\u0120the", "\u0120past", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "\u0120inquiry", "\u0120will", "\u0120examine", "\u0120the", "\u0120use", "\u0120of", "\u0120undercover", "\u0120officers", "\u0120in", "\u0120the", "\u0120past", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "\u0120inquiry", "\u0120will"], "token_logprobs": [-9.5367431640625e-07, -0.1300048828125, -0.56103515625, -0.269775390625, -0.40380859375, -0.20263671875, -0.12493896484375, -2.1457672119140625e-06, -1.3232231140136719e-05, -0.04241943359375, -0.30810546875, -0.6240234375, -0.77783203125, -0.11932373046875, -0.004261016845703125, 0.0, -0.6767578125, -0.0021038055419921875, -0.00013494491577148438, -0.0013360977172851562, -0.0002732276916503906, -1.6689300537109375e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -3.5762786865234375e-07, -0.0027370452880859375, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -0.004856109619140625, -7.152557373046875e-07, -1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -7.486343383789062e-05, 0.0, -0.001018524169921875, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -6.604194641113281e-05, 0.0, -0.00019347667694091797, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": 0.0, "The": -0.00019347667694091797, "\u0120inquiry": 0.0, "\u0120will": 0.0, "\u0120examine": 0.0, "\u0120the": 0.0, "\u0120use": 0.0, "\u0120of": 0.0, "\u0120undercover": 0.0, "\u0120officers": 0.0, "\u0120in": 0.0, "\u0120past": 0.0, ".": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}
{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: The All Blacks were five points behind at half-time with a man in the sin-bin as four penalties from Handre Pollard cancelled out Jerome Kaino's early try. A Dan Carter drop-goal and a Beauden Barrett try put the champions ahead. South Africa replied with two penalties but a Carter effort in between secured victory despite ferocious Bok defence. It was seldom pretty but once again in this World Cup there was a gripping finale, the All Blacks holding that two-point lead for the last 12 minutes as their opponents finally tired. No team has ever retained the Webb Ellis trophy, but the All Blacks will be favourites to do so when they meet either Australia or Argentina next Saturday after finding their way through a brutal encounter. This was nothing like the free-flowing attacking rugby that had eviscerated France in the quarter-finals, but in its own way it was just as admirable, as South Africa refused to buckle despite having just 43% possession. The game swung in the 20 minutes after half-time, New Zealand beginning that period five points down and with Kaino off the pitch, but ending it five points up and with Springbok wing Bryan Habana in the sin-bin instead. And despite replacement Pat Lambie cutting the lead to less than a score, the vast experience of the champions saw them through. After Pollard's early penalty, the All Blacks struck back when Kaino thundered through De Jager down the right and touched down one-handed in the corner, but two more pin-point penalties from Pollard gave his side a two-point lead with 20 minutes gone. South Africa were having significant success at the breakdown, New Zealand shipping six penalties in short order, and the world champions looked instead for territory, kicking behind the defence and into the corners. Carter hit the post with a long-range penalty, and despite his side dominating possession and territory the Springbok defensive wall continued to hold. When South Africa finally made it out of their half, they struck again. Kaino was sin-binned for kicking the ball away and Pollard stroked over his fourth penalty to make it 12-7 at the interval, the green-shirted supporters in the capacity crowd starting to believe that the upset was on. The Springboks had not lost to the All Blacks in 21 Tests when leading or level at half-time, but despite being a man down New Zealand closed the gap to two points as a spell of carefully worked territory was capped with a Carter drop-goal. Schalk Burger then lost the ball metres from his own line, the All Blacks went right and drove on through their forwards before Ma'a Nonu sent replacement Barrett diving into the corner. With Habana sin-binned for knocking the ball from scrum-half Aaron Smith's hands and Carter bending over the conversion for 17-12, the match appeared to have turned. Pollard and Carter exchanged penalties, and with replacements pouring on to the pitch and the rain hammering down the two heavyweights went toe to toe. Pat Lambie came on for Pollard to make it 20-18 with 10 minutes to go, and an air of desperation was apparent in both sides. Carter sprinted half the length of the pitch to clear from De Allende, South Africa failed to capitalise from an attacking line-out and New Zealand escaped into opposition territory as the seconds crawled by, running the clock down with a series of drives to celebrate with exhaustion at the end. Ben Smith was faultless under the high ball and Dan Carter's decision-making once again peerless. However, for his muscular, repeated carrying in a relentlessly physical match and the superb run and timing of pass for Beauden Barrettt's critical second-half try, Ma'a Nonu deserves the honour. New Zealand coach Steve Hansen: \"It was always going to be close, they're a great side and they showed that again. I was really proud of our guys, they kept their composure. \"We just needed to come out for the second half and start taking the game to them rather than waiting for them to take it to us. We talked about it at half-time. We talked about keeping composure and talked about winning the first 10 minutes.\" South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer: \"Our discipline in the second half was just not good enough. They coped better with the weather in the second half. Discipline was the most important thing, especially in these rainy conditions. \"We wanted to make our country proud but we didn't. We should have pulled this win through but all credit to the All Blacks, they are a quality side.\" South Africa: Le Roux; Pietersen, Kriel, de Allende, Habana; Pollard, du Preez; Mtawarira, B. du Plessis, Malherbe; Etzebeth, de Jager; Louw, Burger, Vermeulen Replacements: Serfontein for de Allende (80), Lambie for Pollard (66), Nyakane for Mtawarira (53), Strauss for B. du Plessis (53), J. du Plessis for Malherbe (60), Matfield for de Jager (60), Alberts for Burger (64) Not Used: Pienaar Sin Bin: Habana (52) New Zealand: B.

The National Trust is using ground-penetrating radar on the 174ft (53m) tower to see under its stone cladding. Ken Evans, from the trust, said the work was \"crucial\". Built on one of the highest points of the Blackdown Hills, the landmark was put up as a tribute to the Duke of Wellington's military achievements at the Battle of Waterloo. But according to the trust, it has been struck by lightning twice in its history and renovating the very tall landmark every 10 to 15 years has been \"expensive and unsustainable\". Mr Evans, the trust's building surveyor, said the radar study was one of several being carried out to \"understand this unique and somewhat complex monument\". \"We have been using wind and movement sensors which have already surprised us by showing that it doesn't flex in the wind quite as much as we expected,\" he said. \"The ground-penetrating radar seeks to identify voids and gaps in the stonework under the surface but should also tell us more about the materials which were used to build the obelisk.\" Data from the detailed survey will also be used to build a computer model of the obelisk and help with a \"more effective repair approach\".\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A computer model of one of the world's tallest three-sided obelisks is being made to find out why it is falling apart.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe National Trust is using ground penetrating radar to see if the Wellington Monument is safe to repair.\n\nQuestion: What is the most important thing you learned from this article?\n\nGround penetrating radar is a noninvasive way to see what is below the surface of the earth.\n\nQuestion: What i", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "The", "\u0120National", "\u0120Trust", "\u0120is", "\u0120using", "\u0120ground", "\u0120penetrating", "\u0120radar", "\u0120to", "\u0120see", "\u0120if", "\u0120the", "\u0120Wellington", "\u0120Monument", "\u0120is", "\u0120safe", "\u0120to", "\u0120repair", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Question", ":", "\u0120What", "\u0120is", "\u0120the", "\u0120most", "\u0120important", "\u0120thing", "\u0120you", "\u0120learned", "\u0120from", "\u0120this", "\u0120article", "?", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Ground", "\u0120penetrating", "\u0120radar", "\u0120is", "\u0120a", "\u0120non", "in", "vasive", "\u0120way", "\u0120to", "\u0120see", "\u0120what", "\u0120is", "\u0120below", "\u0120the", "\u0120surface", "\u0120of", "\u0120the", "\u0120earth", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Question", ":", "\u0120What", "\u0120is"], "token_logprobs": [-4.565715789794922e-05, -0.1561279296875, -0.0167999267578125, -7.152557373046875e-07, -0.0472412109375, -0.006519317626953125, -0.0038318634033203125, -0.01251220703125, -2.384185791015625e-07, -0.0010881423950195312, -0.4833984375, -0.06829833984375, -0.09161376953125, -0.0016698837280273438, -0.49560546875, -0.411376953125, -0.376953125, -0.3193359375, -0.83203125, -0.00041103363037109375, -0.0142669677734375, 0.0, -0.966796875, -0.430908203125, -0.6123046875, -0.00888824462890625, -0.0022220611572265625, -0.76171875, -0.044586181640625, -0.25390625, -0.59375, -0.1063232421875, -0.5546875, -0.01554107666015625, -1.2874603271484375e-05, -2.6226043701171875e-06, -0.000457763671875, -4.76837158203125e-07, -0.5439453125, -0.02630615234375, -1.1324882507324219e-05, -0.1197509765625, -0.035125732421875, -1.0048828125, -0.0297088623046875, 0.0, -0.18603515625, -0.01331329345703125, -0.64306640625, -0.2066650390625, -0.024658203125, -0.54736328125, -0.00022208690643310547, -0.00835418701171875, -0.386962890625, -0.045745849609375, -0.38330078125, -1.7642974853515625e-05, -0.023345947265625, 0.0, -0.00574493408203125, -0.06353759765625, -0.0277862548828125, -0.01334381103515625], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": 0.0, "The": -0.1561279296875, "\u0120National": -0.0167999267578125, "\u0120Trust": -7.152557373046875e-07, "\u0120is": -0.01334381103515625, "\u0120using": -0.006519317626953125, "\u0120ground": -0.0038318634033203125, "\u0120penetrating": -0.02630615234375, "\u0120radar": -1.1324882507324219e-05, "\u0120to": -0.01331329345703125, "\u0120see": -0.64306640625, "\u0120if": -0.06829833984375, "\u0120the": -0.045745849609375, "\u0120Wellington": -0.0016698837280273438, "\u0120Monument": -0.49560546875, "\u0120safe": -0.376953125, "\u0120repair": -0.83203125, ".": -1.7642974853515625e-05, "Question": -0.00574493408203125, ":": -0.06353759765625, "\u0120What": -0.0277862548828125, "\u0120most": -0.76171875, "\u0120important": -0.044586181640625, "\u0120thing": -0.25390625, "\u0120you": -0.59375, "\u0120learned": -0.1063232421875, "\u0120from": -0.5546875, "\u0120this": -0.01554107666015625, "\u0120article": -1.2874603271484375e-05, "?": -2.6226043701171875e-06, "Ground": -0.5439453125, "\u0120a": -0.035125732421875, "\u0120non": -1.0048828125, "in": -0.0297088623046875, "vasive": 0.0, "\u0120way": -0.18603515625, "\u0120what": -0.2066650390625, "\u0120below": -0.54736328125, "\u0120surface": -0.00835418701171875, "\u0120of": -0.386962890625, "\u0120earth": -0.38330078125}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}
{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: The world's biggest clothing retailer posted net earnings of \u20ac1.26bn (\u00a31.1bn) in the six months to 31 July - up 8% on the same period last year. Sales jumped from \u20ac9.4bn to \u20ac10.5bn, an increase of 11%. The group's clothes can now be bought online in around 40 countries, it said. Inditex operates eight brands in 90 countries including Pull&Bear, Massimo Dutti and Bershka. How Zara's founder became the richest man in the world - for two days Chairman and chief executive Pablo Isla emphasised the firm's investment in technology, saying the firm had expanded its online stores to 11 new countries in the period. It also launched mobile phone payment in all its Spanish stores, with the objective of \"extending the service to other countries\". This will encompass online apps for all of its brands and a specific app for the whole group called InWallet. Mr Isla said: \"Both our online and bricks-and-mortar stores are seamlessly connected, driven by platforms such as mobile payment, and other technological initiatives that we will continue to develop.\" Tom Gadsby, an analyst at Liberum, said the firm's \"online drive\" was important. \"I expect over the years they may find they don't have to open as many stores to maintain their strong growth rate as the online channel will become increasingly important,\" he said. \"And while Zara is available in many of the territories in which they operate [online], most of their other brands aren't readily available outside Europe online. \"So there is a big opportunity there for them to expand online into new territories.\" The company also said it had benefited from steady economic growth in Spain, where Inditex gets about a fifth of its sales. That country's clothing market grew at an average of 3% in the three-months to the end of July, according to the Spanish statistics agency.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: With a television audience of 110 million, it's one of the biggest platforms in the world - and Gaga has been putting in the hours to ensure her set is suitably spectacular. \"We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show,\" she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. \"And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far.\" She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: \"Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BOOM! \"And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BLAM! BORN TO RUN!\" It led to the memorable headline: \"America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch\" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring \"Justice 4 Mario Woods\" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year. You can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX. She raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic. For the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers. 1987's show was altogether more bizarre. A magician named \"Elvis Presto\" burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics. At the culmination of the show, the \"Prince of Prestidigitation\" performed an interactive magic trick (\"pick a card, concentrate real hard\") while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses. It was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach. She arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous \"left shark\". He was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves. It quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star. And when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend. Poor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob. Few ever believed that the \"wardrobe malfunction\" was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified (notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press). Nonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered. But there is a bright side to this story. A PayPal employee called Jawed Karim missed the half-time show and grew frustrated that he couldn't watch the incident online. In response, he and his friends Steve Chen and Chad Hurley began coding a website where people could upload their own content. That site would end up being YouTube.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: It comes as a documentary, The Betrayed Girls is being shown on BBC One about nine Asian men jailed for grooming teenage girls in the town in 2012. Laura, who was abused by the gang from the age of 13 until she was 17, said the targeting of girls by Asian men was still going on in Greater Manchester. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said it was \"committed\" to tackling abusers. Laura, whose identity is protected as a victim of a sex crime, told BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire show said she was walking in Oldham town centre through an Asian community a couple of months ago. \"I was still getting cars pulling over to me asking me if I wanted to go for a drink,\" said Laura. \"It's not bothering them. I don't actually think they understand that they are doing something wrong.\" Nazir Afzal the north west's former chief crown prosecutor who brought the case against the Rochdale gang said five years on some victims nationally are still not being listened to. Mr Afzal overturned a decision not to charge nine men who ran the child sex exploitation ring. He said there have been \"significant rises\" in investigations and prosecutions into the crime and victims were more confident in reporting abuse and they are getting better support. However, he said: \"Victim support groups nationally are still telling me victims are not being consistently listened to and told the case is too difficult to bring [to court].\" He also said some victims of historical child sex exploitation were being told that police were focusing on current cases, too. Mr Afzal said agencies must be more proactive and more \"collaborative working\" was needed between the police, councils and other agencies and voluntary groups.

Steve Rumbelow, chief executive of Rochdale Borough Council, said: \"Since 2012 the council and its partners have worked to make the changes needed, to increase knowledge, prevent harm, challenge those who wish to exploit children and better support victims and survivors.\" The documentary which features testimonies from victims for the first time follows a BBC One drama Three Girls.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: According to three separate analyses, a flood of automated comments to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was detected over the weekend. More than 400,000 comments with remarkably similar wording have been detected in recent days. Net neutrality proponents argue that all internet traffic should be equal. This means that no content provider should be able to, for example, charge more for faster access to certain data. One expert described bot activity as a new form of protest. \"Someone has gone out of their way to make these seem like real submissions,\" wrote Chris Sinchok in a blog post about the apparently automated activity. Having downloaded the comments and associated data, Mr Sinchok noticed that the names and email addresses associated with thousands of them also turned up in lists of personal data stolen from websites. He told the BBC that this suggested someone might be using information collected from breached databases to make the submissions look more authentic. \"It really seems like this is getting pooled from some place in an automated fashion and it's coming in at unreasonable rates,\" he said. He added that the uniformity of the data was also a possible giveaway. For example, many comments are essentially identical save for the occasional, small difference - such as the exact same sentence appearing in multiple comments, but with different letters capitalised each time. And the rate at which comments were posted also seemed suspicious, starting and stopping in bursts, he added. Other watchers, including a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and another at Harvard University, have also tracked a boom in apparently automated activity directed at the site in recent days. Earlier this month, the FCC said it had been targeted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that led to downtime for the comments system. This followed a television appearance by comedian John Oliver in which he urged people to post comments against the proposals on the FCC's website. \"Net neutrality is such a hot-button issue and it's one of the few examples of online activism that's actually amounted to something,\" noted Prof Phil Howard at the Oxford Internet Institute. He cited the 2014 online protests, after which President Obama stepped in to recommend that the FCC drop earlier proposals to curtail net neutrality. \"This is how people protest these days,\" said Prof Howard, referring to the apparently automated comments. He also pointed out that a growing number of people had the necessary programming skills to do it. However, Mr Sinchok is concerned that the bot activity will create the impression that genuine opposition to the FCC's current proposals does not really exist. \"There are people that care about this issue a lot,\" he told the BBC. \"Activity like this is really muddying the waters - and I don't want it to give [the FCC] an excuse to say, 'Hey, there's mixed support for this.'\" The FCC has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Bots appear to be spamming a US regulator's website over a proposed reversal of net neutrality rules, researchers have said.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe FCC is receiving a large amount of automated comments.\n\nHow did you do?\n\nSummarize the following article in 1-2 sentences.\n\nThe FCC is receiving a large amount of automated comments.\n\nSummarize the following article in 1-2 sentences.\n\nThe FC", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "The", "\u0120FCC", "\u0120is", "\u0120receiving", "\u0120a", "\u0120large", "\u0120amount", "\u0120of", "\u0120automated", "\u0120comments", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "How", "\u0120did", "\u0120you", "\u0120do", "?", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Sum", "mar", "ize", "\u0120the", "\u0120following", "\u0120article", "\u0120in", "\u01201", "-", "2", "\u0120sentences", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "\u0120FCC", "\u0120is", "\u0120receiving", "\u0120a", "\u0120large", "\u0120amount", "\u0120of", "\u0120automated", "\u0120comments", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Sum", "mar", "ize", "\u0120the", "\u0120following", "\u0120article", "\u0120in", "\u01201", "-", "2", "\u0120sentences", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "\u0120FCC"], "token_logprobs": [-9.298324584960938e-06, -0.215087890625, -0.0032787322998046875, -0.378173828125, -0.86279296875, -0.06201171875, -0.062103271484375, -0.32470703125, 0.0, -0.2919921875, -0.0001671314239501953, -0.576171875, -0.024322509765625, 0.0, -0.144775390625, -0.9765625, -0.0009860992431640625, -0.052215576171875, -0.0001811981201171875, -0.00011265277862548828, 0.0, -1.00390625, -0.0007171630859375, -3.254413604736328e-05, -0.0015411376953125, -0.2119140625, -0.2349853515625, -0.0186309814453125, -0.0633544921875, -0.62451171875, -0.0010995864868164062, -0.00011897087097167969, -0.01432037353515625, -1.5497207641601562e-06, 0.0, -0.023834228515625, -0.0007376670837402344, -0.068359375, -0.026885986328125, -0.01546478271484375, -0.0010585784912109375, -0.039276123046875, 0.0, -0.0501708984375, -2.384185791015625e-06, -0.0266876220703125, -0.003452301025390625, -2.7418136596679688e-06, -0.0244293212890625, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00010263919830322266, -0.1654052734375, -0.0002875328063964844, -0.0092010498046875, -0.0002655982971191406, -0.0004630088806152344, -0.00041747093200683594, -2.2292137145996094e-05, -1.7881393432617188e-06, -1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.0, -0.005718231201171875, -3.3020973205566406e-05], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": 0.0, "The": -0.005718231201171875, "\u0120FCC": -3.3020973205566406e-05, "\u0120is": -0.068359375, "\u0120receiving": -0.026885986328125, "\u0120a": -0.01546478271484375, "\u0120large": -0.0010585784912109375, "\u0120amount": -0.039276123046875, "\u0120of": 0.0, "\u0120automated": -0.0501708984375, "\u0120comments": -2.384185791015625e-06, ".": -1.7881393432617188e-06, "How": -0.144775390625, "\u0120did": -0.9765625, "\u0120you": -0.0009860992431640625, "\u0120do": -0.052215576171875, "?": -0.0001811981201171875, "Sum": -0.0244293212890625, "mar": 0.0, "ize": 0.0, "\u0120the": -0.00010263919830322266, "\u0120following": -0.1654052734375, "\u0120article": -0.0002875328063964844, "\u0120in": -0.0092010498046875, "\u01201": -0.0002655982971191406, "-": -0.0004630088806152344, "2": -0.00041747093200683594, "\u0120sentences": -2.2292137145996094e-05}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Listening to the things we're going to do to change that, if people come down from now they will find a very different experience. \"The infrastructure is still well away from where it needs to be but there are plans to develop that.\" Cotton, 69, a former England and British and Irish Lions prop returned to Sale - a club he served as both a player and director - after Simon Orange's takeover of the Premiership side in June. He has promised to be active in his role, despite his commitments with his clothing business. \"What I really want to see is a very strong north of England club that can compete at the highest level,\" he added. \"That is my motivation for giving up the precious thing that I have got, and that is my time. \"I think what was lacking before was that the board weren't very often represented at games home and away, and I think that is very wrong - board members will travel to away games and home games.\" One of the standout announcements from Sale's new 10-man board was that director of rugby Steve Diamond will have a seat on it. However, Cotton insists there will be no conflict of interest with a member of the coaching staff also working as a director. \"It will put no strain whatsoever on the relationship, we're here to support him,\" Cotton continued. \"We'll be working very closely with Diamond to make sure we can achieve the ambition which we all hold - if we went down we'd still be with them.\" Diamond also confirmed they are close to signing a new full-back and are still looking for another player to add to their backline, with former Bath and London Welsh winger Nick Scott on trial with the club.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "New Sale Sharks chairman Fran Cotton has conceded they must work to restore their relationship with some fans.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nSale Sharks' new director of rugby Steve Cotton says the club will be a \"very different\" place to attend matches this season.\n\nWhat is the most interesting thing about the above article?\n\nSale Sharks have been promoted to the Premiership and will play at the AJ Bell Stadium in Manchester.", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "S", "ale", "\u0120Sharks", "'", "\u0120new", "\u0120director", "\u0120of", "\u0120rugby", "\u0120Steve", "\u0120Cotton", "\u0120says", "\u0120the", "\u0120club", "\u0120will", "\u0120be", "\u0120a", "\u0120\"", "very", "\u0120different", "\"", "\u0120place", "\u0120to", "\u0120attend", "\u0120matches", "\u0120this", "\u0120season", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "What", "\u0120is", "\u0120the", "\u0120most", "\u0120interesting", "\u0120thing", "\u0120about", "\u0120the", "\u0120above", "\u0120article", "?", "\u010a", "\u010a", "S", "ale", "\u0120Sharks", "\u0120have", "\u0120been", "\u0120promoted", "\u0120to", "\u0120the", "\u0120Premiership", "\u0120and", "\u0120will", "\u0120play", "\u0120at", "\u0120the", "\u0120AJ", "\u0120Bell", "\u0120Stadium", "\u0120in", "\u0120Manchester", ".", "\u010a"], "token_logprobs": [-7.212162017822266e-05, -0.05218505859375, -2.1457672119140625e-06, -0.0008549690246582031, -0.91064453125, -0.0014705657958984375, -0.176025390625, -0.0007781982421875, 0.0, -0.0004887580871582031, -0.0007796287536621094, -0.207763671875, -0.56494140625, -5.364418029785156e-05, -0.346435546875, -0.10687255859375, -0.669921875, -0.53857421875, -0.041534423828125, -5.4836273193359375e-05, -0.38720703125, -0.6025390625, -0.21142578125, -0.59423828125, -0.66943359375, -0.54833984375, -4.4345855712890625e-05, -0.0006060600280761719, -0.3583984375, 0.0, -0.11529541015625, -0.089111328125, -0.0253143310546875, -0.11444091796875, -0.1162109375, -0.05615234375, -0.11053466796875, -0.296875, -0.306640625, -0.01507568359375, -1.895427703857422e-05, -3.123283386230469e-05, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -0.5537109375, 0.0, -0.00015413761138916016, -0.435791015625, -0.6474609375, -1.091796875, -0.004131317138671875, -0.0001081228256225586, -0.07745361328125, -0.61279296875, -0.13330078125, -0.379638671875, -0.357421875, -0.0127716064453125, -8.344650268554688e-07, 0.0, -2.765655517578125e-05, -0.5595703125, -0.8818359375, -0.054229736328125, -0.0242462158203125], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": -0.0242462158203125, "S": -0.5537109375, "ale": 0.0, "\u0120Sharks": -0.00015413761138916016, "'": -0.91064453125, "\u0120new": -0.0014705657958984375, "\u0120director": -0.176025390625, "\u0120of": -0.0007781982421875, "\u0120rugby": 0.0, "\u0120Steve": -0.0004887580871582031, "\u0120Cotton": -0.0007796287536621094, "\u0120says": -0.207763671875, "\u0120the": -0.0127716064453125, "\u0120club": -5.364418029785156e-05, "\u0120will": -0.13330078125, "\u0120be": -0.10687255859375, "\u0120a": -0.669921875, "\u0120\"": -0.53857421875, "very": -0.041534423828125, "\u0120different": -5.4836273193359375e-05, "\"": -0.38720703125, "\u0120place": -0.6025390625, "\u0120to": -0.004131317138671875, "\u0120attend": -0.59423828125, "\u0120matches": -0.66943359375, "\u0120this": -0.54833984375, "\u0120season": -4.4345855712890625e-05, ".": -0.054229736328125, "What": -0.11529541015625, "\u0120is": -0.089111328125, "\u0120most": -0.11444091796875, "\u0120interesting": -0.1162109375, "\u0120thing": -0.05615234375, "\u0120about": -0.11053466796875, "\u0120above": -0.306640625, "\u0120article": -0.01507568359375, "?": -1.895427703857422e-05, "\u0120have": -0.435791015625, "\u0120been": -0.6474609375, "\u0120promoted": -1.091796875, "\u0120Premiership": -0.07745361328125, "\u0120and": -0.61279296875, "\u0120play": -0.379638671875, "\u0120at": -0.357421875, "\u0120AJ": -8.344650268554688e-07, "\u0120Bell": 0.0, "\u0120Stadium": -2.765655517578125e-05, "\u0120in": -0.5595703125, "\u0120Manchester": -0.8818359375}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}
{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: The film about a princess's mythical journey in ancient Polynesia took an estimated $81.1m (\u00a365.3m) on its debut. That makes it the second-highest Thanksgiving debut of all time, behind Disney's Frozen, which took $93.6m (\u00a375.3m) on its release in 2013. Some observers have said that Moana and its merchandise are appropriating Pacific Island culture. Disney withdrew a children's costume promoting the film after activists branded it \"brownface\", or mocking of their culture by stereotyping. The costume, a full-body suit with brown skin, traditional tattoos, grass skirt and bone necklace, represented the character Maui, considered a demi-god and ancestor by many Polynesians. Disney said it regretted any offence. JK Rowling's Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them fell to second on the US chart, taking $65.8m (\u00a353m). Gossip surrounding Brad Pitt's marriage break-up failed to spark a huge amount of interest in his World War Two romance Allied, which also stars Marion Cotillard. It took $18m (\u00a314.4m) over the long weekend, having cost $85m (\u00a368.5m) to make, landing in fourth spot behind Doctor Strange. Kyle Davies, Paramount's head of domestic distribution, said the film appealed to \"older audiences\" but noted those \"don't storm the theatres [on] weekend one\". \"I think they're going to take their time,\" he added. Warren Beatty fared worse - his first film in 15 years, the 1950s Hollywood comedy Rules Don't Apply, took just $2.2m (\u00a31.7m). The film is Beatty's first directed feature since 1998's Bulworth. Bad Santa 2, released 13 years after the original and again starring Billy Bob Thornton, did a little better, taking $9m (\u00a37.3m).

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: They made the connection on an expedition to the boy's village, Meliandou. They took samples and chatted to locals to find out more about Ebola's source. The team's findings are published in EMBO Molecular Medicine. Meliandou is a small village of 31 houses. It sits deep within the Guinean forest region, surrounded by towering reeds and oil palm cultivations - these are believed to have attracted the fruit bats carrying the virus passed on to Emile. During their four-week field trip in April 2014, Dr Fabian Leendertz and colleagues found a large tree stump situated about 50m from Emile's home. Villagers reported that children used to play frequently in the hollow tree. Emile - who died of Ebola in December 2013 - used to play there, according to his friends. The villagers said that the tree burned on March 24, 2014 and that once the tree caught fire, there issued a \"rain of bats\". A large number of these insectivorous free-tailed bats - Mops condylurus in Latin - were collected by the villagers for food, but disposed of the next day after a government-led ban on bushmeat consumption was announced. While bushmeat is thought to be a possible source of Ebola, the scientists believe it didn't trigger the outbreak. Instead, it was Emile's exposure to the bats and their droppings as he played with his friends in the hollowed tree. The scientists took and tested ash samples from the tree and found DNA traces that were a match for the animals. While they were unable to test any of the bushmeat that the villagers had disposed of, they captured and tested any living bats they could find in and around Meliandou. No Ebola could be detected in any of these hundred or so animals, however. But previous tests show this species of bat can carry Ebola. Dr Leendertz, from the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, and his colleagues say this must be a pretty rare occurrence though. Dr Leendertz said: \"That is also obvious when you think about how many tonnes of bat meat is consumed every year. \"If more bats carried the virus, we would see outbreaks all the time.\" He says it is vital to find out more about the bats. \"They have moved into human settlements. They do not just live in the trees but also under the roofs of houses in the villages. \"The Ebola virus must jump through colonies from bat to bat, so we need to know more.\" But culling the animals is not the answer. \"We need to find ways to live together with the wildlife. These bats catch insects and pests, such as mosquitoes. They can eat about a quarter of their body weight in insects a day. \"Killing them would not be a solution. You would have more malaria.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The Ebola victim who is believed to have triggered the current outbreak - a two-year-old boy called Emile Ouamouno from Guinea - may have been infected by playing in a hollow tree housing a colony of bats, say scientists.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe scientists have found that the Ebola virus was likely transmitted to Emile Emile by a fruit bat.\n\nQuestion 2\n\nSummarize the above article in 1-2 sentences.\n\nThe scientists have found that the Ebola virus was likely transmitted to Emile Emile by a fruit bat.", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "The", "\u0120scientists", "\u0120have", "\u0120found", "\u0120that", "\u0120the", "\u0120Ebola", "\u0120virus", "\u0120was", "\u0120likely", "\u0120transmitted", "\u0120to", "\u0120Em", "ile", "\u0120Em", "ile", "\u0120by", "\u0120a", "\u0120fruit", "\u0120bat", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Question", "\u01202", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Sum", "mar", "ize", "\u0120the", "\u0120above", "\u0120article", "\u0120in", "\u01201", "-", "2", "\u0120sentences", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "\u0120scientists", "\u0120have", "\u0120found", "\u0120that", "\u0120the", "\u0120Ebola", "\u0120virus", "\u0120was", "\u0120likely", "\u0120transmitted", "\u0120to", "\u0120Em", "ile", "\u0120Em", "ile", "\u0120by", "\u0120a", "\u0120fruit", "\u0120bat", ".", "\u010a"], "token_logprobs": [-6.67572021484375e-06, -0.54443359375, -0.2047119140625, -1.0654296875, -0.0599365234375, -0.1363525390625, -0.91357421875, -0.061920166015625, -0.004787445068359375, -0.10223388671875, -0.4970703125, -0.06048583984375, -0.364013671875, -0.8505859375, 0.0, -0.04388427734375, 0.0, -0.72998046875, -0.31103515625, -0.23193359375, -6.115436553955078e-05, -0.0799560546875, -0.03973388671875, 0.0, -1.201171875, -0.44775390625, -0.2197265625, 0.0, -0.9951171875, -4.76837158203125e-07, 0.0, -3.528594970703125e-05, -0.39892578125, -0.0003592967987060547, -0.1357421875, -0.2362060546875, -0.267333984375, -0.0013265609741210938, -0.0011911392211914062, -9.846687316894531e-05, -2.2649765014648438e-06, -2.2530555725097656e-05, -0.0416259765625, -0.00487518310546875, -0.0013017654418945312, -4.279613494873047e-05, -0.00016176700592041016, -0.06494140625, -2.0742416381835938e-05, -2.384185791015625e-06, -0.0025997161865234375, -0.0017347335815429688, -1.1563301086425781e-05, -0.0236053466796875, -0.0011806488037109375, 0.0, -0.003082275390625, 0.0, -0.00010144710540771484, -0.003444671630859375, -0.00186920166015625, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -2.5391578674316406e-05, -0.00014793872833251953], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": -0.00014793872833251953, "The": -0.0416259765625, "\u0120scientists": -0.00487518310546875, "\u0120have": -0.0013017654418945312, "\u0120found": -4.279613494873047e-05, "\u0120that": -0.00016176700592041016, "\u0120the": -0.06494140625, "\u0120Ebola": -2.0742416381835938e-05, "\u0120virus": -2.384185791015625e-06, "\u0120was": -0.0025997161865234375, "\u0120likely": -0.0017347335815429688, "\u0120transmitted": -1.1563301086425781e-05, "\u0120to": -0.0236053466796875, "\u0120Em": -0.003082275390625, "ile": 0.0, "\u0120by": -0.00010144710540771484, "\u0120a": -0.003444671630859375, "\u0120fruit": -0.00186920166015625, "\u0120bat": -1.1920928955078125e-07, ".": -2.5391578674316406e-05, "Question": -1.201171875, "\u01202": -0.44775390625, "Sum": -0.9951171875, "mar": -4.76837158203125e-07, "ize": 0.0, "\u0120above": -0.39892578125, "\u0120article": -0.0003592967987060547, "\u0120in": -0.1357421875, "\u01201": -0.2362060546875, "-": -0.267333984375, "2": -0.0013265609741210938, "\u0120sentences": -0.0011911392211914062}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

He continued: \"She's had two previous babies and she's been in labour for 10 hours, so obviously if that's the case then I've got a bit of time to 'pot some balls and hurry up' sort of thing. \"As I say, we need to talk the next day or two because we thought it'd be out by now. \"But being the stubborn Little Miss Bingham it's going to be, I think she's a bit too comfortable in my missus' belly.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Stuart Bingham may pull out of the Masters if his wife goes into labour with their third child.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nBarry Hearn has said he will play in the World Championship if his wife gives birth to their first child before the tournament starts.\n\nWhat does the article say about the situation?\n\nBarry Hearn, the chairman of the World Snooker Tour, has said he will play in the Worl", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "B", "arry", "\u0120Hear", "n", "\u0120has", "\u0120said", "\u0120he", "\u0120will", "\u0120play", "\u0120in", "\u0120the", "\u0120World", "\u0120Championship", "\u0120if", "\u0120his", "\u0120wife", "\u0120gives", "\u0120birth", "\u0120to", "\u0120their", "\u0120first", "\u0120child", "\u0120before", "\u0120the", "\u0120tournament", "\u0120starts", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "What", "\u0120does", "\u0120the", "\u0120article", "\u0120say", "\u0120about", "\u0120the", "\u0120situation", "?", "\u010a", "\u010a", "B", "arry", "\u0120Hear", "n", ",", "\u0120the", "\u0120chairman", "\u0120of", "\u0120the", "\u0120World", "\u0120Sn", "ook", "er", "\u0120Tour", ",", "\u0120has", "\u0120said", "\u0120he", "\u0120will", "\u0120play", "\u0120in", "\u0120the", "\u0120World"], "token_logprobs": [-2.3365020751953125e-05, -0.1920166015625, -0.475830078125, -0.1939697265625, -5.9604644775390625e-06, -0.537109375, -0.6845703125, -0.322021484375, -0.54150390625, -0.199462890625, -0.016387939453125, -0.05487060546875, -0.020782470703125, -0.392333984375, -0.01204681396484375, -0.0005884170532226562, -1.9073486328125e-06, -0.0180816650390625, 0.0, -0.280029296875, -0.289306640625, -0.29638671875, -4.267692565917969e-05, -0.3115234375, -0.0005741119384765625, -0.0211944580078125, -0.953125, -0.00281524658203125, -0.05010986328125, 0.0, -0.2734375, -0.0310211181640625, -0.2452392578125, -0.6181640625, -0.01386260986328125, -0.10675048828125, -0.63330078125, -0.7421875, -1.4662742614746094e-05, -2.86102294921875e-06, -2.384185791015625e-07, -0.021209716796875, -1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.61669921875, -0.092529296875, -0.325927734375, -2.6226043701171875e-06, -0.0028057098388671875, -1.52587890625e-05, -0.0002257823944091797, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0005035400390625, -0.000133514404296875, -0.10406494140625, -0.00016415119171142578, -0.48681640625, -0.1802978515625, -0.003856658935546875, -0.001094818115234375, -0.0107269287109375, -0.02215576171875], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": -2.384185791015625e-07, "B": -0.021209716796875, "arry": -1.1920928955078125e-07, "\u0120Hear": 0.0, "n": 0.0, "\u0120has": -0.10406494140625, "\u0120said": -0.00016415119171142578, "\u0120he": -0.48681640625, "\u0120will": -0.1802978515625, "\u0120play": -0.003856658935546875, "\u0120in": -0.001094818115234375, "\u0120the": -0.0107269287109375, "\u0120World": -0.02215576171875, "\u0120Championship": -0.392333984375, "\u0120if": -0.01204681396484375, "\u0120his": -0.0005884170532226562, "\u0120wife": -1.9073486328125e-06, "\u0120gives": -0.0180816650390625, "\u0120birth": 0.0, "\u0120to": -0.280029296875, "\u0120their": -0.289306640625, "\u0120first": -0.29638671875, "\u0120child": -4.267692565917969e-05, "\u0120before": -0.3115234375, "\u0120tournament": -0.0211944580078125, "\u0120starts": -0.953125, ".": -0.00281524658203125, "What": -0.2734375, "\u0120does": -0.0310211181640625, "\u0120article": -0.6181640625, "\u0120say": -0.01386260986328125, "\u0120about": -0.10675048828125, "\u0120situation": -0.7421875, "?": -1.4662742614746094e-05, ",": -0.000133514404296875, "\u0120chairman": -0.325927734375, "\u0120of": -2.6226043701171875e-06, "\u0120Sn": -0.0002257823944091797, "ook": 0.0, "er": 0.0, "\u0120Tour": -0.0005035400390625}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: The \u00c2\u00a321.5m Castle Mill development at Port Meadow, by the River Thames, has been widely criticised as ugly and spoiling the view of Oxford's skyline. The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) will put its case to a High Court judge on 23 October. The five-storey university blocks provide 439 accommodation units. The flats overlook a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. CPRE is seeking the judicial review on the basis of Oxford City Council not carrying out an environmental impact assessment. The council has said the challenge was late as the housing had already been built, and it believed the group's claims were unfounded. Helen Marshall, director of CPRE Oxfordshire, said the West Area Planning Committee \"should under no circumstances be rushed into making further poor decisions\". \"We are not yet convinced that the planning condition on contamination has been met,\" she added. \"And the mitigation proposals currently suggested by the university are woefully inadequate to counteract the devastating impact of the buildings on Port Meadow and Oxford's historic skyline. \"A few trees growing to approximately half the height of the buildings in 15 years' time will not meet the brief of 'hiding the buildings in summer and softening their impact in winter' \"Key issues such as the height of the buildings and light pollution still need to be addressed.\" A University of Oxford spokesman said it had \"thought carefully\" about how best to mitigate the impact of the buildings. \"Some measures have already been put in place, and discussions with the city council and others are ongoing about what more we can do,\" he added. \"The University will be making representations at the interim hearing in October on the procedural issues raised by the challenge. \"In the meantime, we intend to finish and occupy the buildings by the start of the next academic year in October as planned.\" The city council said last month it was carrying out an independent review into the case.

Parents described the funding problem as \"diabolical\". A union said the idea was \"terrible\" but families deserved to know the truth about funding. A Department for Education (DfE) spokesman said new funding plans would increase the trust's budget by 2.4%. The Olympus Trust runs one secondary, one all-through school and five primary academies in South Gloucestershire, to the north of Bristol. In the letter Mr Baker warned parents of the \"unthinkable\" decisions the trust could be forced to make from September. These include shortening the school day \"because we cannot afford to staff lessons for the whole week\". Other proposals are cutting teaching and support jobs within the schools, increasing class sizes and reducing the curriculum. The letter also says parents may be asked to make regular financial contributions to supplement school funding. Mr Baker said South Gloucestershire was one of the five worst-funded local authorities so had less reserves to draw upon. Beckie Morton, a parent of two daughters at Charlborough Road Primary School, is anxious about the impact any cuts will have on her girls, aged 10 and seven. She said: \"It's shocking - I don't know what I'd do work-wise if they shortened the school day. \"If they do this, all that will be left is the lessons and no extra support for pupils. \"My eldest daughter suffers panic attacks and has received a lot of pastoral care - this will have a massive impact on her final year there.\" Natalie, who has a son attending at Bradley Stoke Community School, called the proposals \"diabolical\". She said: \"At the moment we are hoping to have a special needs support worker for my son and if they cut funding he won't have that. \"I don't blame the school, they are trying their best.\" In December, the government announced the biggest shake-up of school funding for decades. The DfE said the current system was \"unfair, opaque and outdated\" and the changes would see more than half of England's schools get more cash. \"We recognise that schools are facing cost pressures, which is why we will continue to provide support to help them use their funding in cost-effective ways, including improving the way they buy goods and services, so\u00e2\u20ac\u017d they get the best possible value. \" Kevin Courtney, chair of the National Union of Teachers (NUT), said schools were still facing an 8% reduction in spending power. He said: \"All schools in England will have less money in real terms per pupil in 2020 than they do now. \"This cash they talk about doesn't keep pace with spending pressures on schools. \"The proposals Mr Baker has mentioned are terrible and none of them should happen, but parents deserve to know the truth about the position schools are in.\" The consultation on the new formula runs until 22 March 2017.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Pupils at seven schools could have shorter days after a trust head say he may have to cut hours to save money.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Olympus Trust has been forced to cut staff and reduce class sizes.\n\nWhat is the main idea of the article?\n\nThe government is cutting funding for schools.\n\nWhat is the main idea of the article?\n\nSchools are facing cuts.\n\nWhat is the main idea of th", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "The", "\u0120Olympus", "\u0120Trust", "\u0120has", "\u0120been", "\u0120forced", "\u0120to", "\u0120cut", "\u0120staff", "\u0120and", "\u0120reduce", "\u0120class", "\u0120sizes", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "What", "\u0120is", "\u0120the", "\u0120main", "\u0120idea", "\u0120of", "\u0120the", "\u0120article", "?", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "\u0120government", "\u0120is", "\u0120cutting", "\u0120funding", "\u0120for", "\u0120schools", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "What", "\u0120is", "\u0120the", "\u0120main", "\u0120idea", "\u0120of", "\u0120the", "\u0120article", "?", "\u010a", "\u010a", "School", "s", "\u0120are", "\u0120facing", "\u0120cuts", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "What", "\u0120is", "\u0120the", "\u0120main", "\u0120idea", "\u0120of", "\u0120the"], "token_logprobs": [-2.0265579223632812e-06, -0.1131591796875, -0.9814453125, -0.051300048828125, -0.77978515625, -0.1683349609375, -0.26318359375, -1.7404556274414062e-05, -0.10833740234375, -1.322265625, -0.01477813720703125, -0.17919921875, -0.380859375, -0.0015659332275390625, -0.62646484375, -0.02032470703125, 0.0, -0.810546875, -0.014984130859375, -0.0010251998901367188, -0.11944580078125, -0.00209808349609375, -0.0167083740234375, -0.081298828125, -0.00514984130859375, -3.504753112792969e-05, -1.919269561767578e-05, -4.76837158203125e-07, -0.013763427734375, -0.62841796875, -0.529296875, -0.04913330078125, -0.2340087890625, -0.1650390625, -0.002197265625, -0.1201171875, -0.020172119140625, -2.384185791015625e-07, -0.042144775390625, -0.01438140869140625, -6.341934204101562e-05, -0.0234832763671875, -1.0371208190917969e-05, -0.0095977783203125, -0.00019109249114990234, -0.0019016265869140625, 0.0, -2.384185791015625e-07, 0.0, -0.53662109375, -0.0005831718444824219, -0.000904083251953125, -1.005859375, -0.12371826171875, -0.06707763671875, -3.2186508178710938e-06, 0.0, -0.0826416015625, -0.006237030029296875, -1.895427703857422e-05, -0.0010156631469726562, -3.695487976074219e-05, -0.00044846534729003906, -0.0003800392150878906], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": 0.0, "The": -0.013763427734375, "\u0120Olympus": -0.9814453125, "\u0120Trust": -0.051300048828125, "\u0120has": -0.77978515625, "\u0120been": -0.1683349609375, "\u0120forced": -0.26318359375, "\u0120to": -1.7404556274414062e-05, "\u0120cut": -0.10833740234375, "\u0120staff": -1.322265625, "\u0120and": -0.01477813720703125, "\u0120reduce": -0.17919921875, "\u0120class": -0.380859375, "\u0120sizes": -0.0015659332275390625, ".": -0.06707763671875, "What": -0.0826416015625, "\u0120is": -0.006237030029296875, "\u0120the": -0.0003800392150878906, "\u0120main": -0.0010156631469726562, "\u0120idea": -3.695487976074219e-05, "\u0120of": -0.00044846534729003906, "\u0120article": -0.0019016265869140625, "?": 0.0, "\u0120government": -0.62841796875, "\u0120cutting": -0.04913330078125, "\u0120funding": -0.2340087890625, "\u0120for": -0.1650390625, "\u0120schools": -0.002197265625, "School": -0.53662109375, "s": -0.0005831718444824219, "\u0120are": -0.000904083251953125, "\u0120facing": -1.005859375, "\u0120cuts": -0.12371826171875}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}
{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Many developing countries will try to curb carbon emissions by setting aside forested areas as reserves. But experts are worried that creating national parks often involves removing the people who live in these areas. The study indicated designating forest reserves in Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo could displace as many as 1.3 million people. With funding from Norway, Liberia has proposed 30% of their forests become protected areas by 2020. DR Congo, funded by Germany and the Global Environmental Facility, aims to set aside 12-15% of their forested lands. Consultants TMP Systems concluded: \"Governments have targets to expand their protected areas, and now with new climate funding being available the risk is they will use this to expand in a way that doesn't respect local rights,\" said Andy White, from the Rights and Resources Initiative, the campaign group that sponsored the research. \"It could result in the displacement of millions of people.\" Analysts say that this type of displacement has already happened in sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and Latin America, and sometimes caused violent conflict. \"I don't think the international community wants to displace rural dwellers in Liberia - but I think if we go about it in the way we are talking about it right now, that is going to be the result,\" said Constance Teague, from Liberia's Sustainable Development Institute. \"We need to recognise that indigenous communities respect the forest and they have worked on [it] for hundreds of years. \"It may not look like what the international community may expect, but this effort to conserve the land does exist.\" Liberia had the largest forest space left in West Africa, largely because of the indigenous communities, she added. The report also looks into the costs of compensating people for the loss of their lands in both Liberia and DR Congo, which range from $200m (\u00c2\u00a3137m) to more than \u00c2\u00a31bn.

But the Universities and Colleges Employers Association said the walkout was \"disappointing given the very good pay offer\". Unions representing university support staff are balloting on the offer, with strike action possible in the autumn. UCU says its members have suffered a real-terms pay cut of 14.% since 2009 and complains the squeeze on staff salaries has come as university leaders enjoyed hefty increases. \"A 1.1% pay offer is an insult to hardworking staff, especially in light of the 5% pay rise vice-chancellors have enjoyed while holding down staff pay,\" said general secretary Sally Hunt. \"Industrial action which impacts on students is never taken lightly, but members feel that they have been left with no alternative. \"If the employers wish to see a swift end to this dispute, and avoid further disruption, they need to come back to the table with a much-improved offer.\" Summer exams are still running at some universities, though many have finished. A spokesman for the employers anticipated only \"minor impact and minimal student disruption\". \"Even for examinations which are still taking place at some higher education institutions, more than nine out of 10 report that a no to low impact is anticipated,\" said the spokesman. \"We would like to see the UCU consulting its members on the final offer.\" The employers say the offer is \"at, and, for some, beyond, a limit of affordability for higher education institutions and the very best offer that will be available this year\". They maintain the weighting of the offer means the worst paid university staff will get a rise of more than 5%. They say they have also offered talks on zero-hours contracts and on improving lower pay for female academics. But UCU says it rejected the 1.1% offer as it was only a marginal improvement on the original 1% on which it had balloted members. Ballots of university support staff represented by Unison and Unite are also under way on the improved offer, with both unions recommending it be rejected.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: The government has \"called in\" proposals to shut St Joseph's Primary in Milngavie near Glasgow. The council plans to build a new denominational primary in nearby Bearsden - replacing both St Joseph's and the school on the site at present. Parents at St Joseph's and the Catholic Church have been fighting the plan. East Dunbartonshire Council plans to merge St Joseph's Primary with St Andrew's Primary in neighbouring Bearsden. The merged school would be sited in a new building on the current St Andrew's Primary School site. When the Scottish government calls in any proposal to close a school, it examines the process followed by the council and the information used to reach the decision. But it cannot simply overturn a decision because it disagrees with it. A letter informing the council of the government's decision said ministers were concerned by allegations the council's consultation document contained inaccurate information. It also said concerns raised by Education Scotland may not have been fully addressed by the council in the consultation. A spokesman for the parents at St Joseph's said: \"Parents are delighted that the Scottish government has decided to call this process in. \"It is now clear that the way East Dunbartonshire Council has conducted this process has more holes than a colander. \"We believe and ministers appear to agree that our children will receive the best possible education in their own community.\" Council leader Rhonda Gheekie said: \"This is a complex process and it's understandable that the Scottish government wants to investigate the proposal further. \"We welcome the same opportunity to explain in greater detail the educational benefits that we believe will come from our proposal to build a new \u00a39m denominational primary school for Bearsden and Milngavie. \"We understand the significance of any new school build for the local community and what we all have in common is that we want to get it right to ensure the best possible future education for the young people in the area.\" The council said its proposals were part of its Primary School Improvement Programme to modernise the primary school estate. This aims to deliver state of the art primary schools which are better for pupils and cheaper to run and maintain. Ms Geekie added: \"The council must save a further \u00a320m from its budget over the next three years. On top of the \u00a340m we have already saved, doing nothing in terms of our school estate to help address this was never an option. \"We have to ensure that our school buildings are as cost-effective as they can possibly be to ensure that we are getting value for money from our budget spending.\" Meanwhile, the council's plan to close two primary schools in Kirkintilloch and establish a new \u00a37m school to replace them are to go ahead. The new school there is expected to open in 2016 or 2017.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Controversial proposals to shut a Catholic school in East Dunbartonshire are to be examined by the Scottish government.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe government has called in proposals to close St Joseph's Primary School in Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire.

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: A Leave vote was always seen as more likely to generate significant disturbances in the financial world. For that reason it is also the result which was thought more likely to pose a headache for the world's central banks. There have already been statements from some that they are prepared to act to maintain financial stability. There are two potential issues they might want to respond to in the short term: the stability of the (commercial) banks and swings in exchange rates. With the banks there is a possibility of a general rise in risk aversion, and some might have difficulty borrowing in the inter-bank market. The ultimate danger from that is that they might be unable to make debt payments as they come due. Central banks can address that by lending them extra money (liquidity). In the UK the Bank of England has already been doing this ahead of the referendum, hoping to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity already in place. The Bank has said it \"will continue to monitor market conditions carefully and keep its operations under review\". Other central banks will be ready to take similar action if they think it's needed. What if the strains show up in terms of foreign currency liquidity - say an Italian bank needing quick access to Swiss francs? There are arrangements known as swap lines put in place during the international financial crisis that can be used if necessary. The Italian bank could then get Swiss francs from the European Central Bank (ECB), (and the Swiss National Bank would be able to offer euros to Swiss banks if needed). The Bank of England is involved in these arrangements so it can get foreign currency if British banks were to need it urgently. With sharp moves in exchange rates, there are several options. They could just live with it. But if they felt the swings were too sharp and destabilising they could intervene using their foreign currency reserves. In the case of the UK, the decision to conduct such intervention is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, with the Bank of England carrying it out in the markets. So if there were too precipitous a fall in the value of one currency (sterling would be the obvious candidate in the event of a leave vote) the Bank of England could buy sterling with dollars or yen from its reserves, hoping the additional demand for the pound would support its value. Conversely the Swiss National Bank has been worried about too rapid a rise in the Swiss franc and has already been into the markets to buy other currencies such as the euro with its own national currency. Further action on these lines is a possibility. Currencies seen as havens are susceptible to unwanted sharp rises in times of financial stress and the Swiss franc is a prime example of that. Currency market intervention is often not announced. Some observers say there is evidence suggesting that the Swiss central bank might have intervened over the past week.  The intervention after the vote by the SNB was announced however. Interest rates can also be used to curb currency moves - a cut to stop a currency rising; a rate rise to prevent a fall. Both options, interest rate moves and intervention, can be co-ordinated by central banks. Further quantitative easing (QE) is also a possible response to a rising currency. It tends to drive down market interest rates and there has been some speculation that it might be on the agenda very soon,  perhaps from the Bank of Japan (which does not want to see the yen gaining value). Interest rate moves and QE can also be used to address longer term fallout - to tackle any impact on inflation or growth. The Bank of England has scope to cut rates further and it could undertake further QE. A fall in sterling would be inflationary, though up to a point that could be welcome as inflation is currently (at 0.3%) far below the Bank's target (2%). Another risk is that in a general flight from riskier assets the government debt problem in the eurozone could return, pushing up borrowing costs for countries such as Spain and Italy that were in the firing line a few years ago. Those earlier eurozone storms abated after the ECB announced that it was prepared in some circumstances to buy the bonds, the debts, of governments severely affected. In the event it never used this new weapon. The mere threat of doing so was enough to settle the eurozone bond market. Some observers, such as the London consultancy Capital Economics, think it could finally use this programme, if the aftermath of a leave vote were sufficiently disruptive. The likely timescale for these options varies.  In principle many could be done very quickly. The most urgent, if needed, would probably be bank liquidity. Interest rates and QE could be announced early, but could also be used as a response to economic fallout that might emerge over a longer period. The ECB's option of riding to the rescue of the likes of Spain or Italy would take some time. They would need to have an economic policy programme agreed with the rest of the eurozone. And Spain in particular, with an election this weekend, is itself in a period of political uncertainty that could make it difficult to conduct international negotiations.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Economic policymakers must now decide whether and how they should respond to the UK's vote to leave the EU.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "\nThe Bank of England and the European Central Bank are ready to act if the UK votes to leave the European Union.\n\nSummarize the above article in your own words.\n\nThe Bank of England and the European Central Bank are ready to act if the UK votes to leave the European Union.\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["\u010a", "The", "\u0120Bank", "\u0120of", "\u0120England", "\u0120and", "\u0120the", "\u0120European", "\u0120Central", "\u0120Bank", "\u0120are", "\u0120ready", "\u0120to", "\u0120act", "\u0120if", "\u0120the", "\u0120UK", "\u0120votes", "\u0120to", "\u0120leave", "\u0120the", "\u0120European", "\u0120Union", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "Sum", "mar", "ize", "\u0120the", "\u0120above", "\u0120article", "\u0120in", "\u0120your", "\u0120own", "\u0120words", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "The", "\u0120Bank", "\u0120of", "\u0120England", "\u0120and", "\u0120the", "\u0120European", "\u0120Central", "\u0120Bank", "\u0120are", "\u0120ready", "\u0120to", "\u0120act", "\u0120if", "\u0120the", "\u0120UK", "\u0120votes", "\u0120to", "\u0120leave", "\u0120the", "\u0120European", "\u0120Union", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a"], "token_logprobs": [-0.001129150390625, -0.03289794921875, -0.05712890625, -1.7881393432617188e-06, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -0.67529296875, -0.130859375, -0.25048828125, 0.0, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -0.1322021484375, -0.028533935546875, -0.0008106231689453125, -0.07684326171875, -0.391845703125, -0.07861328125, -0.072265625, -0.08636474609375, -0.0005035400390625, -9.059906005859375e-06, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -0.33056640625, 0.0, -0.1422119140625, -0.2015380859375, 0.0, -0.493408203125, -0.005176544189453125, -9.5367431640625e-07, -0.00010943412780761719, -0.059661865234375, -3.421306610107422e-05, -0.03851318359375, -0.245361328125, -7.152557373046875e-07, 0.0, -7.963180541992188e-05, -2.384185791015625e-06, -3.5762786865234375e-07, -0.0006418228149414062, -8.71419906616211e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -0.039947509765625, -1.049041748046875e-05, -0.0010013580322265625, -1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.0, -0.00991058349609375, -9.226799011230469e-05, 0.0, -4.1604042053222656e-05, -7.557868957519531e-05, -0.0005354881286621094, -0.00020360946655273438, -8.106231689453125e-06, -2.6226043701171875e-06, -1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.0, -0.21923828125, 0.0, -0.0006742477416992188, -0.0115203857421875, -4.1365623474121094e-05], "top_logprobs": [{"\u010a": -4.1365623474121094e-05, "The": -0.0006418228149414062, "\u0120Bank": 0.0, "\u0120of": 0.0, "\u0120England": 0.0, "\u0120and": -0.039947509765625, "\u0120the": 0.0, "\u0120European": -0.21923828125, "\u0120Central": -1.1920928955078125e-07, "\u0120are": -0.00991058349609375, "\u0120ready": -9.226799011230469e-05, "\u0120to": -2.6226043701171875e-06, "\u0120act": -4.1604042053222656e-05, "\u0120if": -7.557868957519531e-05, "\u0120UK": -0.00020360946655273438, "\u0120votes": -8.106231689453125e-06, "\u0120leave": -1.1920928955078125e-07, "\u0120Union": 0.0, ".": -0.0006742477416992188, "Sum": -0.493408203125, "mar": -0.005176544189453125, "ize": -9.5367431640625e-07, "\u0120above": -0.059661865234375, "\u0120article": -3.421306610107422e-05, "\u0120in": -0.03851318359375, "\u0120your": -0.245361328125, "\u0120own": -7.152557373046875e-07, "\u0120words": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

{"request": {"article": "###\nArticle: Tawel Fan ward at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Denbighshire, was closed more than three years ago and a report found some patients were treated like animals. It has emerged that at least seven patients' families were told treatment may have contributed to their deaths. Betsi Cadwaladr health board said an investigation was under way. It acknowledged the quality of care provided could have been a contributory factor to the deaths of some patients. A review of mortality rates on the ward has never been published although it is understood it has been completed. Relatives of one patient told BBC Wales Today they were told medical care on the ward was inadequate. Correspondence seen by the programme included an apology from the health board to the family, who do not want to be identified. One letter said: \"Experts found that there were problems in the health care which may have contributed to the death.\" It added that \"the board is very much engaged in a thorough search for the truth about the Tawel Fan ward\". But the family were unconvinced lessons had been learned and said questions remained unanswered and, as far as they were aware, nobody had lost their job, let alone be prosecuted. The scandal of Tawel Fan pushed the already troubled health board into close supervision by the Welsh Government. It remains in special measures which costs \u00c2\u00a35m a year. An initial report into what happened at Tawel Fan was published almost three years ago. Two more reports are due later this year. One of them, being compiled by the Health and Social Care Advisory Service (Hascas), is expected to include details of a mortality review of Tawel Fan patients.

Solo, 33, will now miss matches on 8 February against France and 13 February against England. This month, domestic violence charges against Solo were dropped. In 2012, Solo, tested positive for a banned substance a month before winning a second Olympic gold medal. She maintained she was not aware the pre-menstrual medication she had been prescribed contained a banned substance and she was cleared of any wrongdoing. The US are preparing for the Women's World Cup in Canada in June when they will aim to win their third title following victories in 1991 and 1999. The latest incident surrounding Solo concerns a training camp being held by the team in Carson, California.
