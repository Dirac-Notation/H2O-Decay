Workers at the charity claim investment in housing would be cheaper than jailing homeless repeat offenders. The Welsh Government said more people than ever were getting help to address housing problems. Changes to the Housing Act in Wales, introduced in 2015, removed the right for prison leavers to be given priority for accommodation. Prison Link Cymru, which helps people find accommodation after their release, said things were generally good for women because issues such as children or domestic violence were now considered. However, the same could not be said for men, the charity said, because issues which often affect them, such as post traumatic stress disorder or drug dependency, were often viewed as less of a priority. Andrew Stevens, who works in Welsh prisons trying to secure housing for prison leavers, said the need for accommodation was \"chronic\". \"There's a desperate need for it, finding suitable accommodation for those leaving prison there is just a lack of it everywhere,\" he said. \"It could take six months to a year, without a lot of help they could be on the streets for six months. \"When you think of the consequences of either being on the street, especially with the cold weather at the moment or you may have a roof over your head, sometimes there is only one choice.\" Mr Stevens believes building more one-bedroom flats could help ease the problem. \"The average price is a hundred pounds a week to keep someone in a rented flat, prison is a lot more than that so I would imagine it would save the public purse quite a few pounds,\" he said. Official figures show 830 one-bedroom properties were built in the year to March 2016, of an overall total of 6,900 new properties in Wales. Marc, 50, who has been in and out of prison for the past 20 years for burglary offences, said he struggled to find accommodation each time he was released. He said he would ask himself: \"Where am I going to stay? Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\" \"You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it. It's like every man for himself, there's nothing.\" Marc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing. \"You feel safe, you got hot food, you've got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It's a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said. Tom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available. \"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven't got accommodation and haven't got provision,\" he said. \"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don't delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can't. \"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\" A Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence. It added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "There is a \"chronic\" need for more housing for prison leavers in Wales, according to a charity.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "A Welsh charity has warned that the number of people sleeping rough in the country is set to rise.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["A", "\u0120Welsh", "\u0120charity", "\u0120has", "\u0120warned", "\u0120that", "\u0120the", "\u0120number", "\u0120of", "\u0120people", "\u0120sleeping", "\u0120rough", "\u0120in", "\u0120the", "\u0120country", "\u0120is", "\u0120set", "\u0120to", "\u0120rise", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "Article", ":", "\u0120The", "\u0120number", "\u0120of", "\u0120people", "\u0120sleeping", "\u0120rough", "\u0120in", "\u0120the", "\u0120UK", "\u0120has", "\u0120risen", "\u0120by", "\u0120almost", "\u0120a", "\u0120fifth", "\u0120in", "\u0120a", "\u0120year", ",", "\u0120according", "\u0120to", "\u0120official", "\u0120figures", ".", "\u0120The", "\u0120Office", "\u0120for", "\u0120National", "\u0120Statistics", "\u0120(", "ONS", ")", "\u0120said", "\u0120there", "\u0120were", "\u01203", ",", "8"], "token_logprobs": [-0.349609375, -0.140869140625, -0.1983642578125, -0.65087890625, -0.425537109375, -0.00275421142578125, -0.278076171875, -0.027008056640625, 0.0, -0.313232421875, -0.1546630859375, -6.210803985595703e-05, -0.0433349609375, -0.123291015625, -0.040985107421875, -0.256103515625, -0.99951171875, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -0.06732177734375, -0.15478515625, -0.0013113021850585938, -1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.08441162109375, -0.88232421875, 0.0, -0.049041748046875, -0.001338958740234375, -3.445148468017578e-05, -0.000762939453125, -0.52294921875, -2.586841583251953e-05, -0.3408203125, -0.2220458984375, -0.27978515625, -0.76171875, -0.00450897216796875, -0.6142578125, -0.0206756591796875, -0.457275390625, -2.2292137145996094e-05, -0.044158935546875, -0.1251220703125, 0.0, -0.619140625, -0.0003628730773925781, -6.4849853515625e-05, -0.0538330078125, -0.476806640625, -8.487701416015625e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0889892578125, 0.0, -2.384185791015625e-06, -0.00043511390686035156, -0.03558349609375, -8.58306884765625e-06, -1.439453125, 0.0, -0.51025390625], "top_logprobs": [{"A": -0.349609375, "\u0120Welsh": -0.140869140625, "\u0120charity": -0.1983642578125, "\u0120has": -0.3408203125, "\u0120warned": -0.425537109375, "\u0120that": -0.00275421142578125, "\u0120the": -0.52294921875, "\u0120number": -0.88232421875, "\u0120of": 0.0, "\u0120people": -0.049041748046875, "\u0120sleeping": -0.001338958740234375, "\u0120rough": -3.445148468017578e-05, "\u0120in": -0.0206756591796875, "\u0120country": -0.040985107421875, "\u0120is": -0.256103515625, "\u0120set": -0.99951171875, "\u0120to": 0.0, "\u0120rise": -0.06732177734375, ".": -6.4849853515625e-05, "\u010a": 0.0, "###": 0.0, "Article": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "\u0120The": -0.0538330078125, "\u0120UK": -2.586841583251953e-05, "\u0120risen": -0.2220458984375, "\u0120by": -0.27978515625, "\u0120almost": -0.76171875, "\u0120a": -0.457275390625, "\u0120fifth": -0.6142578125, "\u0120year": -2.2292137145996094e-05, ",": 0.0, "\u0120according": -0.1251220703125, "\u0120official": -0.619140625, "\u0120figures": -0.0003628730773925781, "\u0120Office": -0.476806640625, "\u0120for": -8.487701416015625e-05, "\u0120National": 0.0, "\u0120Statistics": 0.0, "\u0120(": -0.0889892578125, "ONS": 0.0, ")": -2.384185791015625e-06, "\u0120said": -0.00043511390686035156, "\u0120there": -0.03558349609375, "\u0120were": -8.58306884765625e-06, "\u01203": -1.439453125, "8": -0.51025390625}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Denying the four suspects bail, Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil asked: \"Where was your sense of decency?\" Prosecutors told the court the beating started in a van and continued at a house, where the suspects allegedly forced the 18-year-old white victim, who suffers from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, to drink toilet water and kiss the floor. Police allege the van was earlier stolen by Mr Hill, who is also accused of demanding $300 from the victim's mother while they held him captive, according to the Chicago Tribune. The court was also told the suspects stuffed a sock into his mouth, taped his mouth shut and bound his hands with a belt. In a video made for Facebook Live which was watched millions of times, the assailants can be heard making derogatory statements against white people and Donald Trump. The victim had been dropped off at a McDonalds to meet Mr Hill - who was one of his friends - on 31 December. He was found by a police officer on Tuesday, 3 January, a day after he was reported missing by his parents.

The study, published in the journal Cell, says the diet reboots the body. Experts said the findings were \"potentially very exciting\" as they could become a new treatment for the disease. The experiments were on mice put on a modified form of the \"fasting-mimicking diet\". When people go on it they spend five days on a low calorie, low protein, low carbohydrate but high unsaturated-fat diet. It resembles a vegan diet with nuts and soups, but with around 800 to 1,100 calories a day. Then they have 25 days eating what they want - so overall it mimics periods of feast and famine. Previous research has suggested it can slow the pace of ageing. But animal experiments showed the diet regenerated a special type of cell in the pancreas called a beta cell. These are the cells that detect sugar in the blood and release the hormone insulin if it gets too high. Dr Valter Longo, from the University of Southern California, said: \"Our conclusion is that by pushing the mice into an extreme state and then bringing them back - by starving them and then feeding them again - the cells in the pancreas are triggered to use some kind of developmental reprogramming that rebuilds the part of the organ that's no longer functioning.\" There were benefits in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the mouse experiments. Type 1 is caused by the immune system destroying beta cells and type 2 is largely caused by lifestyle and the body no longer responding to insulin. Further tests on tissue samples from people with type 1 diabetes produced similar effects. Dr Longo said: \"Medically, these findings have the potential to be very important because we've shown - at least in mouse models - that you can use diet to reverse the symptoms of diabetes. \"Scientifically, the findings are perhaps even more important because we've shown that you can use diet to reprogram cells without having to make any genetic alterations.\" BBC reporter Peter Bowes took part in a separate trial with Dr Valter Longo. He said: \"During each five-day fasting cycle, when I ate about a quarter of the average person's diet, I lost between 2kg and 4kg (4.4-8.8lbs). \"But before the next cycle came round, 25 days of eating normally had returned me almost to my original weight. \"But not all consequences of the diet faded so quickly.\" His blood pressure was lower as was a hormone called IGF-1, which is linked to some cancers. He said: \"The very small meals I was given during the five-day fast were far from gourmet cooking, but I was glad to have something to eat\" Peter Bowes: Fasting for science Peter Bowes: Intermittent fasting and the good things it did to my body Separate trials of the diet in people have been shown to improve blood sugar levels. The latest findings help to explain why. However, Dr Longo said people should not rush off and crash diet. He told the BBC: \"It boils down to do not try this at home, this is so much more sophisticated than people realise.\" He said people could \"get into trouble\" with their health if it was done without medical guidance. Dr Emily Burns, research communications manager at Diabetes UK, said: \"This is potentially very exciting news, but we need to see if the results hold true in humans before we'll know more about what it means for people with diabetes. \"People with type-1 and type-2 diabetes would benefit immensely from treatments that can repair or regenerate insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\" Follow James on Twitter.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The pancreas can be triggered to regenerate itself through a type of fasting diet, say US researchers.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "A team of scientists has found that a diet that mimics a fast can help to reverse diabetes in mice.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["A", "\u0120team", "\u0120of", "\u0120scientists", "\u0120has", "\u0120found", "\u0120that", "\u0120a", "\u0120diet", "\u0120that", "\u0120mim", "ics", "\u0120a", "\u0120fast", "\u0120can", "\u0120help", "\u0120to", "\u0120reverse", "\u0120diabetes", "\u0120in", "\u0120mice", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "Article", ":", "\u0120A", "\u0120team", "\u0120of", "\u0120scientists", "\u0120has", "\u0120found", "\u0120that", "\u0120a", "\u0120diet", "\u0120that", "\u0120mim", "ics", "\u0120a", "\u0120fast", "\u0120can", "\u0120help", "\u0120to", "\u0120reverse", "\u0120diabetes", "\u0120in", "\u0120mice", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "Article", ":", "\u0120The", "\u0120study", ",", "\u0120published", "\u0120in", "\u0120the", "\u0120journal", "\u0120Cell"], "token_logprobs": [-0.1929931640625, -0.278564453125, -0.00023567676544189453, -0.0618896484375, -0.07391357421875, -0.471923828125, -0.58251953125, -0.6806640625, -0.0130615234375, -0.634765625, -1.3709068298339844e-05, -2.5033950805664062e-06, -0.2164306640625, -0.10345458984375, -0.08795166015625, -0.06842041015625, -0.482421875, -0.654296875, -0.587890625, -0.19921875, -0.00023102760314941406, -9.083747863769531e-05, -0.0005550384521484375, -1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.33203125, -0.59228515625, -4.374980926513672e-05, -0.0011196136474609375, -0.006687164306640625, -6.401538848876953e-05, -7.963180541992188e-05, -1.3947486877441406e-05, -3.0994415283203125e-06, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928955078125e-07, -0.00047588348388671875, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.6328125, -0.71875, -0.01001739501953125, -0.0001291036605834961, -1.1205673217773438e-05, -0.0007638931274414062, -1.3828277587890625e-05, -2.6106834411621094e-05], "top_logprobs": [{"A": -0.1929931640625, "\u0120team": -0.59228515625, "\u0120of": -4.374980926513672e-05, "\u0120scientists": -0.0011196136474609375, "\u0120has": -0.006687164306640625, "\u0120found": -6.401538848876953e-05, "\u0120that": 0.0, "\u0120a": 0.0, "\u0120diet": -3.0994415283203125e-06, "\u0120mim": 0.0, "ics": 0.0, "\u0120fast": 0.0, "\u0120can": 0.0, "\u0120help": 0.0, "\u0120to": 0.0, "\u0120reverse": 0.0, "\u0120diabetes": -1.1920928955078125e-07, "\u0120in": -1.1205673217773438e-05, "\u0120mice": 0.0, ".": -1.1920928955078125e-07, "\u010a": 0.0, "###": 0.0, "Article": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "\u0120A": -0.33203125, "\u0120The": -0.6328125, "\u0120study": -0.71875, ",": -0.01001739501953125, "\u0120published": -0.0001291036605834961, "\u0120the": -0.0007638931274414062, "\u0120journal": -1.3828277587890625e-05, "\u0120Cell": -2.6106834411621094e-05}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}
