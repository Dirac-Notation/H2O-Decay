Workers at the charity claim investment in housing would be cheaper than jailing homeless repeat offenders. The Welsh Government said more people than ever were getting help to address housing problems. Changes to the Housing Act in Wales, introduced in 2015, removed the right for prison leavers to be given priority for accommodation. Prison Link Cymru, which helps people find accommodation after their release, said things were generally good for women because issues such as children or domestic violence were now considered. However, the same could not be said for men, the charity said, because issues which often affect them, such as post traumatic stress disorder or drug dependency, were often viewed as less of a priority. Andrew Stevens, who works in Welsh prisons trying to secure housing for prison leavers, said the need for accommodation was \"chronic\". \"There's a desperate need for it, finding suitable accommodation for those leaving prison there is just a lack of it everywhere,\" he said. \"It could take six months to a year, without a lot of help they could be on the streets for six months. \"When you think of the consequences of either being on the street, especially with the cold weather at the moment or you may have a roof over your head, sometimes there is only one choice.\" Mr Stevens believes building more one-bedroom flats could help ease the problem. \"The average price is a hundred pounds a week to keep someone in a rented flat, prison is a lot more than that so I would imagine it would save the public purse quite a few pounds,\" he said. Official figures show 830 one-bedroom properties were built in the year to March 2016, of an overall total of 6,900 new properties in Wales. Marc, 50, who has been in and out of prison for the past 20 years for burglary offences, said he struggled to find accommodation each time he was released. He said he would ask himself: \"Where am I going to stay? Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\" \"You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it. It's like every man for himself, there's nothing.\" Marc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing. \"You feel safe, you got hot food, you've got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It's a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said. Tom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available. \"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven't got accommodation and haven't got provision,\" he said. \"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don't delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can't. \"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\" A Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence. It added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "There is a \"chronic\" need for more housing for prison leavers in Wales, according to a charity.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "A Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["A", "\u0120Welsh", "\u0120Government", "\u0120spokesman", "\u0120said", "\u0120the", "\u0120national", "\u0120pathway", "\u0120for", "\u0120homeless", "\u0120services", "\u0120to", "\u0120children", ",", "\u0120young", "\u0120people", "\u0120and", "\u0120adults", "\u0120in", "\u0120the", "\u0120secure", "\u0120estate", "\u0120had", "\u0120prevented", "\u0120many", "\u0120people", "\u0120from", "\u0120losing", "\u0120their", "\u0120home", "\u0120whilst", "\u0120serving", "\u0120their", "\u0120prison", "\u0120sentence", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "Article", ":", "\u0120The", "\u0120number", "\u0120of", "\u0120people", "\u0120in", "\u0120England", "\u0120and", "\u0120Wales", "\u0120living", "\u0120in", "\u0120temporary", "\u0120accommodation", "\u0120has", "\u0120risen", "\u0120to", "\u0120a", "\u0120record", "\u0120high", ".", "\u0120The", "\u0120number", "\u0120of"], "token_logprobs": [-0.88916015625, -0.34716796875, -0.01861572265625, -5.3048133850097656e-05, -0.00017976760864257812, -0.1387939453125, -7.271766662597656e-06, -7.152557373046875e-07, 0.0, -1.430511474609375e-05, 0.0, -9.5367431640625e-07, -2.384185791015625e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -2.384185791015625e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -2.384185791015625e-07, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.9073486328125e-06, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -0.0003361701965332031, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.1920928955078125e-06, 0.0, -0.0498046875, -0.86669921875, 0.0, -0.01561737060546875, -0.165283203125, -1.111328125, -0.01369476318359375, 0.0, -0.1419677734375, -6.413459777832031e-05, -3.552436828613281e-05, -7.152557373046875e-06, -0.00405120849609375, -0.67724609375, -0.424560546875, -0.2294921875, -0.0012874603271484375, -1.1682510375976562e-05, -0.420166015625, -0.09027099609375, -0.578125, -1.0609626770019531e-05], "top_logprobs": [{"A": -0.88916015625, "\u0120Welsh": -0.34716796875, "\u0120Government": -0.01861572265625, "\u0120spokesman": -5.3048133850097656e-05, "\u0120said": -0.00017976760864257812, "\u0120the": 0.0, "\u0120national": -7.271766662597656e-06, "\u0120pathway": -7.152557373046875e-07, "\u0120for": 0.0, "\u0120homeless": -1.430511474609375e-05, "\u0120services": 0.0, "\u0120to": -0.424560546875, "\u0120children": -2.384185791015625e-07, ",": 0.0, "\u0120young": 0.0, "\u0120people": -0.01561737060546875, "\u0120and": -0.01369476318359375, "\u0120adults": 0.0, "\u0120in": -6.413459777832031e-05, "\u0120secure": 0.0, "\u0120estate": 0.0, "\u0120had": -2.384185791015625e-07, "\u0120prevented": 0.0, "\u0120many": 0.0, "\u0120from": 0.0, "\u0120losing": 0.0, "\u0120their": 0.0, "\u0120home": 0.0, "\u0120whilst": -1.9073486328125e-06, "\u0120serving": 0.0, "\u0120prison": -1.1920928955078125e-07, "\u0120sentence": 0.0, ".": -0.420166015625, "\u010a": 0.0, "###": 0.0, "Article": -1.1920928955078125e-06, ":": 0.0, "\u0120The": -0.09027099609375, "\u0120number": -0.578125, "\u0120of": -1.0609626770019531e-05, "\u0120England": -1.111328125, "\u0120Wales": 0.0, "\u0120living": -0.1419677734375, "\u0120temporary": -3.552436828613281e-05, "\u0120accommodation": -7.152557373046875e-06, "\u0120has": -0.00405120849609375, "\u0120risen": -0.67724609375, "\u0120a": -0.2294921875, "\u0120record": -0.0012874603271484375, "\u0120high": -1.1682510375976562e-05}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The four have been charged with hate crimes and aggravated kidnapping and battery, among other things. An online fundraiser for their victim has collected $51,000 (\u00c2\u00a342,500) so far. Denying the four suspects bail, Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil asked: \"Where was your sense of decency?\" Prosecutors told the court the beating started in a van and continued at a house, where the suspects allegedly forced the 18-year-old white victim, who suffers from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, to drink toilet water and kiss the floor. Police allege the van was earlier stolen by Mr Hill, who is also accused of demanding $300 from the victim's mother while they held him captive, according to the Chicago Tribune. The court was also told the suspects stuffed a sock into his mouth, taped his mouth shut and bound his hands with a belt. In a video made for Facebook Live which was watched millions of times, the assailants can be heard making derogatory statements against white people and Donald Trump. The victim had been dropped off at a McDonalds to meet Mr Hill - who was one of his friends - on 31 December. He was found by a police officer on Tuesday, 3 January, a day after he was reported missing by his parents. Prosecutors say the suspects each face two hate crimes counts, one because of the victim's race and the other because of his disabilities.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Four people accused of kidnapping and torturing a mentally disabled man in a \"racially motivated\" attack streamed on Facebook have been denied bail.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "The four suspects have been charged with hate crimes and aggravated kidnapping and battery, among other things.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["The", "\u0120four", "\u0120suspects", "\u0120have", "\u0120been", "\u0120charged", "\u0120with", "\u0120hate", "\u0120crimes", "\u0120and", "\u0120aggravated", "\u0120kidnapping", "\u0120and", "\u0120battery", ",", "\u0120among", "\u0120other", "\u0120things", ".", "\u010a", "\u010a", "###", "\u010a", "Article", ":", "\u0120The", "\u0120three", "\u0120men", "\u0120were", "\u0120arrested", "\u0120in", "\u0120the", "\u0120early", "\u0120hours", "\u0120of", "\u0120Wednesday", "\u0120morning", ".", "\u0120The", "\u0120men", ",", "\u0120aged", "\u012020", ",", "\u012021", "\u0120and", "\u012022", ",", "\u0120were", "\u0120arrested", "\u0120in", "\u0120the", "\u0120early", "\u0120hours", "\u0120of", "\u0120Wednesday", "\u0120morning", ".", "\u0120They", "\u0120were", "\u0120arrested", "\u0120in", "\u0120the", "\u0120early"], "token_logprobs": [-0.6494140625, -0.416259765625, -0.0006165504455566406, -0.13232421875, -1.4781951904296875e-05, -2.2649765014648438e-06, -3.5762786865234375e-07, -9.5367431640625e-07, 0.0, -0.00011718273162841797, 0.0, -5.960464477539062e-07, -2.6106834411621094e-05, 0.0, -0.058319091796875, 0.0, 0.0, -3.5762786865234375e-07, -5.960464477539062e-07, -0.0133514404296875, -1.1920928955078125e-07, 0.0, 0.0, -2.86102294921875e-06, 0.0, -0.2685546875, -0.084228515625, -0.322021484375, -0.8701171875, -0.049591064453125, -0.9912109375, -0.0771484375, -0.050872802734375, -8.344650268554688e-07, -4.76837158203125e-06, -0.82763671875, -0.05230712890625, -0.6865234375, -0.6845703125, -0.93701171875, -0.26318359375, -0.04541015625, -0.72607421875, -0.004444122314453125, -0.445556640625, -0.0003571510314941406, -0.28564453125, -5.960464477539062e-07, -0.051849365234375, -0.18603515625, -0.2353515625, -0.0026073455810546875, -0.000232696533203125, 0.0, 0.0, -3.0994415283203125e-06, -1.6689300537109375e-06, -0.0919189453125, -0.626953125, -0.19189453125, -0.50048828125, -0.1082763671875, -0.002269744873046875, -5.0067901611328125e-06], "top_logprobs": [{"The": -0.6494140625, "\u0120four": -0.416259765625, "\u0120suspects": -0.0006165504455566406, "\u0120have": -0.13232421875, "\u0120been": -1.4781951904296875e-05, "\u0120charged": -2.2649765014648438e-06, "\u0120with": -3.5762786865234375e-07, "\u0120hate": -9.5367431640625e-07, "\u0120crimes": 0.0, "\u0120and": -0.0003571510314941406, "\u0120aggravated": 0.0, "\u0120kidnapping": -5.960464477539062e-07, "\u0120battery": 0.0, ",": -5.960464477539062e-07, "\u0120among": 0.0, "\u0120other": 0.0, "\u0120things": -3.5762786865234375e-07, ".": -0.0919189453125, "\u010a": 0.0, "###": 0.0, "Article": -2.86102294921875e-06, ":": 0.0, "\u0120The": -0.6845703125, "\u0120three": -0.084228515625, "\u0120men": -0.93701171875, "\u0120were": -0.19189453125, "\u0120arrested": -0.50048828125, "\u0120in": -0.1082763671875, "\u0120the": -0.002269744873046875, "\u0120early": -5.0067901611328125e-06, "\u0120hours": 0.0, "\u0120of": 0.0, "\u0120Wednesday": -3.0994415283203125e-06, "\u0120morning": -1.6689300537109375e-06, "\u0120aged": -0.04541015625, "\u012020": -0.72607421875, "\u012021": -0.445556640625, "\u012022": -0.28564453125, "\u0120They": -0.626953125}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The study, published in the journal Cell, says the diet reboots the body. Experts said the findings were \"potentially very exciting\" as they could become a new treatment for the disease. The experiments were on mice put on a modified form of the \"fasting-mimicking diet\". When people go on it they spend five days on a low calorie, low protein, low carbohydrate but high unsaturated-fat diet. It resembles a vegan diet with nuts and soups, but with around 800 to 1,100 calories a day. Then they have 25 days eating what they want - so overall it mimics periods of feast and famine. Previous research has suggested it can slow the pace of ageing. But animal experiments showed the diet regenerated a special type of cell in the pancreas called a beta cell. These are the cells that detect sugar in the blood and release the hormone insulin if it gets too high. Dr Valter Longo, from the University of Southern California, said: \"Our conclusion is that by pushing the mice into an extreme state and then bringing them back - by starving them and then feeding them again - the cells in the pancreas are triggered to use some kind of developmental reprogramming that rebuilds the part of the organ that's no longer functioning.\" There were benefits in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the mouse experiments. Type 1 is caused by the immune system destroying beta cells and type 2 is largely caused by lifestyle and the body no longer responding to insulin. Further tests on tissue samples from people with type 1 diabetes produced similar effects. Dr Longo said: \"Medically, these findings have the potential to be very important because we've shown - at least in mouse models - that you can use diet to reverse the symptoms of diabetes. \"Scientifically, the findings are perhaps even more important because we've shown that you can use diet to reprogram cells without having to make any genetic alterations.\" BBC reporter Peter Bowes took part in a separate trial with Dr Valter Longo. He said: \"During each five-day fasting cycle, when I ate about a quarter of the average person's diet, I lost between 2kg and 4kg (4.4-8.8lbs). \"But before the next cycle came round, 25 days of eating normally had returned me almost to my original weight. \"But not all consequences of the diet faded so quickly.\" His blood pressure was lower as was a hormone called IGF-1, which is linked to some cancers. He said: \"The very small meals I was given during the five-day fast were far from gourmet cooking, but I was glad to have something to eat\" Peter Bowes: Fasting for science Peter Bowes: Intermittent fasting and the good things it did to my body Separate trials of the diet in people have been shown to improve blood sugar levels.

These are two of the biggest firms in the lucrative international business of making spectacles. France's Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy's Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer. It is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is. \"The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,\" says Essilor. But there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry. Gordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: \"This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user. \"Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them. \"Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,\" Mr Ilett adds. If the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry. It will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica. One long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors. \"If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,\" he argues. In his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up. \"I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,\" he adds. Unless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by. But if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor. Just a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was \"an undisputed leader with only 25% market share\" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses. When it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market. For its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace. In 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses. The overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories. Market research firm GFK describes the optical industry as \"a complex and extremely competitive market-space\". Even so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (\u00c2\u00a312.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review. These are: An inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers. A Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal. \"The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,\" he said. \"We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,\" he added. The EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules. But the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution. \"Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,\" the firm says. \"It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself.\" If you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds. Of course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers. Opticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit. They also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising. But for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business. On worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros. For the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros. With cost-cutting at a merged business projected to save between 400m and 600m euros per year, profits could be boosted even further.

She is the latest high-profile cyclist to come forward after Jess Varnish, Nicole Cooke and Emma Pooley criticised the World Class programme. Houvenaghel told the BBC she felt \"vindicated\" by a leaked draft report detailing British Cycling's failures. The report said British Cycling \"sanitised\" its own investigation into claims former technical director Shane Sutton used sexist language towards Varnish, who went public last April about her treatment. British Cycling subsequently admitted it did not pay \"sufficient care and attention\" to the wellbeing of staff and athletes at the expense of winning medals, an approach Houvenaghel attested to in her BBC interview. Both Sutton and predecessor Sir Dave Brailsford have now left British Cycling. Houvenaghel, 42, spoke to BBC Sport during its State of Sport week, which on Thursday examines the issue of athlete welfare versus a win-at-all-costs culture. A government-commissioned review, headed by 11-time Paralympic champion Baroness Grey-Thompson, into safety and wellbeing in British sport, is due to be published imminently. It is expected to recommend significant reforms designed to improve the way athletes are treated by governing bodies. Houvenaghel claimed: British Cycling said it \"has acknowledged and takes very seriously previous cultural and governance failings in the World Class Programme\". It said it has accepted the draft report's findings and already put into a place a 39-point action plan to \"systematically address the cultural and behavioural shortcomings\". The statement added: \"Our new chair Jonathan Browning has apologised for instances where we have fallen short in our commitment to athlete welfare and has offered to meet with anyone who can help improve British Cycling.\" Who else has spoken out? Houvenaghel won silver in the individual pursuit at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and gold in the World Championship team pursuit in 2008, 2009 and 2011. She retired in 2014, aged 39, after withdrawing from the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow with a back injury. Houvenaghel was critical of both Sutton and her team-mates in the aftermath of the London 2012 Olympics, where she was left out of all three team pursuit races as Dani King, Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell-Shand won gold in a world record time. Speaking to BBC Sport this week, the Northern Irish rider said that experience was \"very traumatic\" and she felt \"torment\" at having \"no explanation\" for her last-minute omission. At the time, Brailsford, then performance director, defended the selection saying they had to \"take the personal element out of it, and look at the data and be professional\". He added: \"I think when a team steps up and makes six world records on the trot and a gold medal, then I don't think you can argue with that.\" British Cycling reiterated that point on Thursday, adding it was \"proud to support Wendy in what was a wonderfully successful cycling career\" and she was \"part of a pioneering generation of riders who set new standards of excellence\", but was dropped in London 2012 \"based on her performance\". Other elite cyclists, including King and Roswell-Shand have praised the leadership at British Cycling. Asked whether she was simply not good enough for the 2012 team, Houvenaghel replied: \"It was definitely not about performance. I don't think the fastest team on the day were permitted to race. \"There are certain chosen riders on the team who will not have experienced the culture of fear and will not have been on the receiving end of that - the bullying, the harassment, being frozen out of opportunities. \"It was horrid - it was not the training environment I expected. There was no choice. If you rocked the boat, you were out. There was no alternative. \"Medals at any cost, that's how it was whenever I was there, certainly in 2012.\" Houvenaghel said she also witnessed the sexism that has been highlighted by other female riders, and also claims she was discriminated against because of her age. \"I can certainly relate to the bullying,\" she said. \"For me personally, I felt it was more ageism - being a little bit older than my team-mates, it didn't seem to be something that the staff necessarily wanted for our team in 2012. \"They didn't care about what happened to me afterwards. I never heard another thing from them. \"After six years of constantly medalling at World Cups, World Championships, nationals, both on the track and on the road, they discarded me in a very undignified way from the team, which I don't feel was right.\" Fourteen-time Paralympic gold medallist Dame Sarah Storey told BBC Sport that elite level sport in Britain is \"cut-throat\" but there are \"no excuses for crossing that line\" into bullying. Asked about the balance between winning and athlete welfare, the 39-year-old replied: \"It's a really difficult question because you have to be a human being, you have to allow for people to make mistakes. But the currency is race wins, the currency is gold medals. \"It's not an excuse but you have to have a thick skin in sport, you have to be able to take the rough with the smooth because of the racing that you go through. \"But there are no excuses for crossing that line, and if those lines have been crossed they will be found out and they'll be dealt with.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A \"medal at any cost\" approach created a \"culture of fear\" at British Cycling, says former rider Wendy Houvenaghel.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "A former British Cycling technical director has admitted he did not pay \"sufficient care and attention\" to the wellbeing of staff and athletes at the expense of winning medals.
